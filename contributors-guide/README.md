# Contributors Guide

There are three types of contributors that we are targeting for this phase of the Mojaloop project.

## Developers or General Contributors

These individuals are those that want to start contributing to the Mojaloop community.  This could be a developer or quality assurance person that wants to write new code or fix a bug.  This could also be a business, compliance or risk specialist that wants to help provide rules, write documentation or participate in requirements gathering.

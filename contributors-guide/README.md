# Contributors Guide

## How do I contribute?

### Review the Deployment Guide

Review the Mojaloop deployment guide and follow the instructions for deployment:

* \[Deployment and Setup MD\]

  \([https://github.com/mojaloop/docs/blob/develop/WorkShops/Presentations/Mojaloop\_Phase2\_Wrap-up\_Deployment-Day3\_V2.0-published.pdf](https://github.com/mojaloop/docs/blob/develop/WorkShops/Presentations/Mojaloop_Phase2_Wrap-up_Deployment-Day3_V2.0-published.pdf)\).

### What work is needed?

Work is tracked as issues in GitHub. You'll see issues there that are open and marked as bugs, stories, or epics. An epic is larger work that contains multiple stories. Anything that is in the backlog and not assigned to someone are things we could use help with. Stories that have owners are in someone's backlog already, though you can always ask about them in the issue or on Slack.

There's a [roadmap](https://github.com/mojaloop/mojaloop/blob/master/contribute/Roadmap.md) that shows larger work that people could do or are working on. It has some main initiatives and epics and the order, but lacks dates as this work is community driven. Work is broken down from there into issues in GitHub.

In general, we are looking for example implementations and bug fixes, and project enhancements.

### Where do I get help?

Join the [Mojaloop Slack Discussions](https://mojaloop-slack.herokuapp.com/) to connect with other developers.

Also checkout the [FAQ](https://github.com/mojaloop/mojaloop/blob/master/FAQ.md)

### What is the current release?

See the [Mojaloop Slack Announcements](https://mojaloop-slack.announcements) to find out information on the lastest release.

### Where to I send bugs, questions, and feedback?

UPDATE: For bugs, see [Reporting bugs](https://github.com/mojaloop/mojaloop/blob/master/contribute/Reporting-Bugs.md).

### Pull Request Process

It's a good idea to ask about major changes on [Slack](https://mojaloop.slack.com). Submit pull requests which include both the change and the reason for the change. Pull requests will be denied if they violate the [Level One Principles](https://leveloneproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/L1P_Level-One-Principles-and-Perspective.pdf)

### Style guides and templates  UPDATE

* [Documentation standards](https://github.com/mojaloop/mojaloop/blob/master/contribute/Documentation-and-Template-Standards.md)
* [Documentation style guide](https://github.com/mojaloop/mojaloop/blob/master/contribute/Documentation-Style-Guide.md)
* [Code Style](https://github.com/mojaloop/mojaloop/blob/master/contribute/Code-Style.md)
* [Code Quality Metrics](https://github.com/mojaloop/mojaloop/blob/master/contribute/Code-Quality-Metrics.md)

### Code of conduct UPDATE

We use a [standard developer code of conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html)

### Licensing

See [License](https://github.com/mojaloop/mojaloop/blob/master/contribute/License.md) policy

### What version?

Naturally, we use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/), and each repo has it's own version. Update the version appropriately when you submit a pull request. Example: git tag v0.4.0 \# update the version.

### Additional Information UPDATE

For additional information please review the [frequently asked questions](https://github.com/mojaloop/documentation/tree/5c7ed2fbb64393b6d224e73d68351bff5b4bed4e/FAQ.md).

## Types of Contributors

There are three types of contributors that we are targeting for this phase of the Mojaloop project.

### Developers or General Contributors

These individuals are those that want to start contributing to the Mojaloop community. This could be a developer or quality assurance person that wants to write new code or fix a bug. This could also be a business, compliance or risk specialist that wants to help provide rules, write documentation or participate in requirements gathering.

### Hub Operators

Typically these or organizations or individuals or goverment agencies that are interested in setting up their own Mojaloop Switch to become part of the ecosystem.

### Implementation Teams

Implementation teams can assist banks, goverment offices, mobile operators or credit unions in deploying Mojaloop.

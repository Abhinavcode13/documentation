Overview","keywords":"","body":"Mojaloop Overview\nMojaloop is open source software for creating digital payments platforms that connect all customers, merchants, banks, and other financial providers in a country's economy. Rather than a financial product or application in itself, Mojaloop establishes a blueprint for technology that bridges all the financial products and applications in any given market.\nThe basic idea behind Mojaloop is that we need to connect multiple Digital Financial Services Providers (DFSPs) together into a competitive and interoperable network in order to maximize opportunities for poor people to get access to financial services with low or no fees. We don't want a single monopoly power in control of all payments in a country, or a system that shuts out new players. It also doesn't help if there are too many isolated subnetworks.\n\nOur model addresses these issues in several key ways:\n\nA set of central services provides a hub through which money can flow from one DFSP to another. This is similar to how money moves through a central bank or clearing house in developed countries. Besides a central ledger, central services can provide identity lookup, fraud management, and enforce scheme rules.\nA standard set of interfaces a DFSP can implement to connect to the system, and example code that shows how to use the system. A DFSP that wants to connect up can adapt our example code or implement the standard interfaces into their own software. The goal is for it to be as straightforward as possible for a DFSP to connect to the interoperable network.\nComplete working open-source implementations of both sides of the interfaces - an example DFSP that can send and receive payments and the client that an existing DFSP could host to connect to the network.\n\nThe intention for the Mojaloop project is for financial institutions and commercial providers to use the open-source software to help build digital, interoperable payments platforms that drive financial inclusion on a national scale. Specifically, the platforms will enable seamless, low-cost transactions between individual users, merchants, banks, providers, and even government offices - helping connect poor customers with everyone else in the digital economy.\n"},"mojaloop-background/":{"url":"mojaloop-background/","title":"Mojaloop Background","keywords":"","body":"Mojaloop Background\nMojaloop Background\nMojaloop grew out of principles set forth by the Financial Services for the Poor team at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. These principles form the cornerstone of the Level One Project, which is the foundation's initiative for designing and implementing digital financial services and systems to include and benefit the world's 2 billion unbanked. The code won't address the gap in digital financial services on its own, but it can help service providers open markets and accelerate progress.\nDigital and mobile technologies make it possible to reach new customers in developing markets with innovative, low-cost financial services. The lack of a shared platform, though, means that financial providers have to build everything on their own. This raises costs and keeps the digital financial industry from growing and innovating as fast as it could.\nWith support and funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Mojaloop was designed by a team of leading tech and fintech companies: Ripple, Dwolla, ModusBox, Software Group and Crosslake Technologies. It is available now as an open-source project. Free to be used and adapted by anyone under the Apache 2.0 license. For more information on how Mojaloop ties into the larger initiative of financial inclusion, visit LevelOneProject.org.\n"},"mojaloop-background/core-scenarios.html":{"url":"mojaloop-background/core-scenarios.html","title":"Core Scenarios","keywords":"","body":"Core Scenarios\nAbout Mojaloop Scenarios\nMojaloop addresses a number of scenarios in which this software might help the poor to meet their financial and banking needs. There are several different paths for each of these scenarios, including potential timeout issues and reversals (which are handled as a separate transaction). The most common paths include:\n\nSend money to anyone\nBuy goods\nBulk Payments\nTier Risk Levels\nFraud Checks and Blacklists\nAccount Management\nCheck Account and POS\n\nScenario Descriptions\nSend money to anyone\nHamim is working on his farm in Northern Uganda when he receives an urgent phone call from his brother, Kani. Kani is low on money and will not get paid until next week. Kani has no money to pay for food for his family and asks Hamim to help him out. Hamim and Kani have no means of transportation and it would take several days for Hamim to get to his Kani's home in Southern Uganda. While they both have mobile flip phones, they use different financial service providers. Kani tells Hamim that he needs 5,000 shillings to buy food until he gets paid next week for his job working in a local field. Hamin agrees to send Kani the money.\n        *** Mojaloop technology does its job ***\n\nBecause Hamim has sent money to Kani before he has his information on his phone. Hamim sees Kani's name come up on his phone and he starts the transaction. He also sees the total fees and any exchange rates he has to pay before he sends the money. He is happy for that validation and that the transaction goes the same way every time. In under 30 seconds, Hamim is able to send the money to his Kani and verifies that he got it. Hamim is happy he was able to help out Kani and his family so quickly so they can buy food.\nBuy Goods\nVenya is waiting in line to buy plantains at her local market. She is corralling her elder child with one hand and has her baby in a sling. She often comes to this seller and she knows he has a good price. She also knows that even though she carries no money and he is not on her financial network, she can buy from him. As she approaches the head of the line she juggles the children and pulls out a simple flip phone. She tells him 1.5 kilograms and he tells her the price, which she agrees to.\n        *** Mojaloop technology does its job ***\n\nBecause she's been here before the merchant already has her information on his phone. The only information he has is her user number. This makes Venya feel safe that the merchant does not have her mobile phone number. The merchant enters in the amount for the plantains. Almost instantaneously, Venya sees the merchants invoice on her phone and she is glad she is able to pay for the transaction using her mWallet account. She is happy that the transaction goes the same way every time, because half of her attention is on the children. She has friends who can't read and they are able to buy things this way too by following the simple order of the transaction. In under 30 seconds, she is able to send the money to the merchant and both Venya and the merchant get confirmation of the transaction. She tells the elder child to pick up her plantains and makes room for the next person in line.\nBulk Payments\nNikisha is the accountant for one of the largest manufacturing companies in Johannesburg and employs over 250 workers. Their company uses a time and attendance system to track the number of hours that each employee works along with their hourly rate and employee ID. On a weekly basis Nikisha gets an update on her bulk payment system that shows all the employees, their user ID along and amount to be paid. Since the companies employees all have different financial service providers this system makes it really easy for Nikisha to confirm and distribute their pay with a couple of clicks. The company has a high turnover rate so new employees who get their first paycheck are automatically prompted to open an account as long as they provided a valid mobile number when they started. As Nikisha gets ready to send out this week's payments she opens up a bulk payment report.\n*** Mojaloop technology does its job ***\n\nThe bulk report for payments comes up by date range and, since Nikisha does this weekly, there are several items she needs to verify each time. Specifically, she looks for any errors or alerts for employees with invalid phone numbers, names not matching or other anomalies. Nikisha has the ability to follow-up with her co-workers or employees directly to fix these errors before sending out the payments. In addition, Nikisha is also notified of any employees who don't have an account setup. For these users, Nikisha is still able to push a payment through and the employee will be prompted by text message to open an account. Nikisha is thankful she has this process that makes it much easier to distribute funds. Once Nikisha has completed her validation, she sends it to her supervisor for final approval. Nikisha is glad to have this system in place because several years ago, Nikisha and her supervisor had to pay employees in cash and use a manual system to verify payments were received which made her feel very uneasy.\nTier Risk Levels\nSalem works as an auditor for a large bank in Kampala, Uganda. His job is to monitor, manage and reduce risk for the company. order to do so each new user ID in the system is assigned a default tier level which means they can only transfer a small number and amount of funds in and out of the system over specific periods of time. As users acquire greater balances in their accounts and hold their accounts for longer periods of time their tier levels improve. Tier levels are handled automatically by the system so Salem does not need to worry about assigning or changing these levels under normal circumstances. Part of Salem's job as an auditor is to review the daily reports to ensure that everyone's funds are safe and secure and he kicks off his daily report to review the accounts.\n*** Mojaloop technology does its job ***\n\nThis morning when Salem reviews these reports he notices that one specific user ID has 32 outgoing transactions in one day which exceeds their daily count of 25. This seems very suspicious to Salem and he goes ahead and contacts the customer. It turns out that this customer is a local merchant that owns a store. The merchant explains that he has to go to the market on a weekly basis to get ingredients for his restaurant and it is not uncommon for him and his staff to make more than 25 purchases in one day. Although this customer has only been with Salem's bank for a month then have a healthy balance in their account. Salem goes ahead and upgrades the customers tier level to increase the daily and weekly transaction counts.\nFraud Checks and Blacklists\nSalem works as an auditor for a large bank in Kampala, Uganda. His job is to monitor and stop any fraudulent activity for the company. While the company has a set of rules that might flag individuals for Salem to investigate, he also has the authority to screen any user ID for fraudulent activities at any time. Each time Salem performs a fraud check on a user ID, the system records the date of the last check along with any comments that Salem might have made. This makes it very easy for Salem to search for IDs that might have never been checked for fraud or have not been checked in a very long time. Salem has been monitoring one particular ID that seems to have had an increased amount of incoming funds deposited into their account on a daily basis. Today he does a search of the user ID to investigate further.\n*** Mojaloop technology does its job ***\n\nWhen the user ID is retrieved Salem is able to see the customer's name, birthdate and national ID number. He also sees any additional IDs and the account type associated with this customer. Upon further inspection Salem sees once again the number and amount of transactions deposited into this account has doubled again today. Salem suspects that this user is involved in some illegal activity and would like to send this up to his supervisor to get someone to do a deeper investigation. In the meantime to ensure that the illegal funds don't continue to come into the system, Salem decides to 'freeze' the account. Salem does this by checking the blacklist button and indicating a reason for the blacklist. At this point any future deposits or withdrawals for this User ID will be denied until someone from the Bank removes them from the blacklist. Salem feels good that no additional funds that might of come from illegal or unapproved sources will be deposited into this customer account.\nAccount Management\nTadeo just bought his first mobile flip phone for him and his family to share. He is happy that he finally has a phone that he can use in emergencies, but he can also finally keep his money secure by opening up a bank account. Tadeo has never had a bank account since he lives in a very remote part of Africa with no personal means of transportation. Tadeo and his family have to rely on bartering or cash to buy any goods they need at the market. Although Tadeo is not proficient in reading, he is able to easily use his phone to setup and account for him and his family by following a couple of easy to read menu steps.\n*** Mojaloop technology does its job ***\n\nTadeo was able to use his phone to create an mWallet account using his National ID. He was also asked to create a unique pin which made him feel secure in case him or someone in the family lost the phone. Tadeo is the primary account owner and he was able to easily create a new account for his oldest son. He was very pleased that he could have separate accounts for his son. His son is married and lives with Tadeo but does not have a phone. Since his son works it is only fair that they should be able to spend his money on goods and foods that he and his wife prefer. Tadeo also adds his wife as a user on his account. He allows his wife to be a signatory since she does most of the shopping at the local market and now has the ability to pay for goods using this phone. Tadeo is very happy that his wife no longer needs to have cash or carry barter goods to the market.\nCheck Account and POS\nJahari has a flip phone that all the family uses and he has setup different user numbers for each family member. Jahari is at the local market and needs to buy some meat for his family. Before he does, he wants to make sure he has enough funds in his account to purchase the goods and still have enough left over to set aside for future medical expenses and education. Jahari is happy that his money is secure and he is able to check his account balance anytime he needs to by simply entering his secure pin on his phone. Once he confirms his balance he will buy some goat and cow meat at the market.\n    *** Mojaloop technology does its job ***\n\nAfter Jahari has entered his pin on his phone he is able to see his account balance. He is also able to see to see any of his recent transactions as well as any fees that were associated with these transactions. After confirming his available funds he picks out his meat and brings it up to the merchant for payment. The merchant does a lot of business in this market and has a point of sales device. This is very helpful for Jahari and his family since they only have one phone and many times his wife or his children go to the market and do not have the phone with them. The merchant is able to enter the purchase amount on the POS device and Jahari or any of his family members securely enters their user number and reviews the transaction. Jahari confirms that the amount on the POS machine matches what the merchant verbally told him and he enters his pin to approve the transaction.\n*** Mojaloop technology does its job ***\n\nThe merchant gets confirmation that he received payment and he prints a receipt for Jahari. Since Jahari has his phone with him today he also re-checks his account balance again to confirm that appropriate funds were taken from his account. Jahari is happy that this is an easy process and he can see that he has plenty of money left to set aside this month for his family to use on education or health expenses.\n"},"mojaloop-background/level-one-principles.html":{"url":"mojaloop-background/level-one-principles.html","title":"Level One Principles","keywords":"","body":"Level One Principles\nThe Level One Project Guide outlines a vision of how an inclusive digital financial services system can work for the benefit of poor people.

Kubernetes\nThis section will guide the reader through the deployment process to setup Kubernetes.\nIf you are new to Kubernetes it is strongly recommended to familiarize yourself with Kubernetes. Kubernetes Concepts is a good place to start and will provide an overview.\nThe following are Kubernetes concepts used within the project. An understanding of these concepts is imperative before attempting the deployment;\n\nDeployment\nPod\nReplicaSets\nService\nIngress\nStatefulSet\nDaemonSet\nIngress Controller\nConfigMap\nSecret\n\nInsure kubectl is installed. A complete set of installation instruction are available here\n3.1 Kubernetes Dashboard:\n\nKubernetes Dashboard roles, services & deployment.\nInstall for Dashboard using Helm (not needed if MicroK8s is installed): kubernetes-dashboard\nIMPORTANT: Always verify the current kubernetes-dashboard yaml file is still correct as used in the below command.\nkubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v1.10.1/src/deploy/recommended/kubernetes-dashboard.yaml\n\nIf you have installed MicroK8s, enable the MicroK8s dashboard;\nmicrok8s.enable dashboard\n\nRemember to prefix all kubectl commands with microk8s if you opted not to create an alias.\n\nVerify Kubernetes Dashboard;\nkubectl get pod --namespace=kube-system |grep dashboard\n\n\nStart proxy for local UI in new terminal;\nkubectl proxy ui\n\n\nOpen URI in default browser:\nhttp://localhost.com:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/#!\nSelect Token. Generate a token to use there by:\nkubectl -n kube-system get secrets | grep dashboard-token\n\nThe token to use is shown on the last line of the output of that command;\nkubectl -n kube-system describe secrets/kubernetes-dashboard-token-btbwf\n\nThe {kubernetes-dashboard-token-btbwf} is retrieved from the output in the previous step. For more information on generating the token, follow the Authentication link in the window.\n\n\n\n4. Helm\nPlease review Mojaloop Helm Chart to understand the relationships between the deployed Mojaloop helm charts.\n4.1 Helm configuration\n\nConfig Helm CLI and install Helm Tiller on K8s cluster:\nhelm init\n\n\nValidate Helm Tiller is up and running:\nkubectl -n kube-system get po | grep tiller\n\n\nAdd mojaloop repo to your Helm config (optional). Linux use with sudo:\nhelm repo add mojaloop http://mojaloop.io/helm/repo/\n\nIf the repo already exists, substitute 'add' with 'apply' in the above command.\n\nAdd the additional dependency Helm repositories. This is needed to resolve Helm Chart dependencies required by Mojaloop charts. Linux use with sudo;\nhelm repo add incubator http://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-charts-incubator\nhelm repo add kiwigrid https://kiwigrid.github.io\n\n\nUpdate helm repositories. Linux use with sudo:\nhelm repo update\n\n\nInstall nginx-ingress for load balancing & external access. Linux use with sudo:\nhelm --namespace kube-public install stable/nginx-ingress\n\n\n\n5. Mojaloop\n5.1 Mojaloop Helm Deployment\n\nInstall Mojaloop. Linux use with sudo:\nDefault installation:\nhelm --namespace demo --name moja install mojaloop/mojaloop\n\nVersion specific installation:\nhelm --namespace demo --name moja install mojaloop/mojaloop -version {version}\n\nList of available versions:\nhelm search -l mojaloop/mojaloop\n\nCustom configured installation:\nhelm --namespace demo --name moja install mojaloop/mojaloop -file {custom-values.yaml}\n\nNote: Download and customize the values.yaml. Note that you should use the value file from the specific version that you will be installing.\n\n\n5.2 Verifying Mojaloop Deployment\n\nUpdate your /ect/hosts for local deployment:\nNote: This is only applicable for local deployments, and is not needed if you are configured a custom DNS or ingress rules via the values.yaml\nvi /etc/hosts\n\nInclude the following line to the config;\n127.0.0.1       interop-switch.local central-kms.local forensic-logging-sidecar.local central-ledger.local central-end-user-registry.local central-directory.local central-hub.local central-settlements.local ml-api-adapter.local\n\n\nTest system health in your browser after installation. This will only work if you have an active helm chart deployment running.\nNote: The examples below are only applicable to a local deployment. The entries should match the DNS values or ingress rules as configured in the values.yaml or otherwise matching any custom ingress rules configured\nml-api-adapter health test:\nhttp://ml-api-adapter.local/health\ncentral-ledger health test:\nhttp://central-ledger.local/health\n\n\n6.

Kubernetes\nKubernetes installation for a local environment.\n2.1 MicroK8S\nWe recommend install directly from the snap store.\nDon't have the snap command? Install snapd first.\n\nInstalling MicroK8s from snap.\nsnap install microk8s --classic\n\n\nVerify MicroK8s is installed and available.\nmicrok8s.status\n\n\nDuring installation you can use the --wait-ready flag to wait for the kubernetes services to initialise.\nmicrok8s.status --wait -ready\n\n\nTo avoid colliding with a kubectl already installed and to avoid overwriting any existing Kubernetes configuration file, MicroK8s adds a microk8s.kubectl command, configured to exclusively access the new MicroK8s install.\nmicrok8s.kubectl get services\n\n\nThis step is only necessary if you require microk8s.kubectl to function as a standard kubectl command. This DOES NOT mean that you can then use kubectl to access OTHER k8s clusters.\nAn example of why you would use this: You have a bash script or 3rd party tool that expects kubectl to be available. E.g. If you want to use Helm, it will not work against microk8s.kubectl, thus one MUST setup the alias for Helm to function correctly.\nsnap alias microk8s.kubectl kubectl\n\nReverting it at any time;\nsnap unalias kubectl\n\nWe will stick with the standard command of prefixing with microk8s. for this guide.\n\nIf you already have kubectl installed and would like to use it to access the MicroK8s deployment.\nmicrok8s.kubectl config view --raw > $HOME/.kube/config\n\n\nView the current context.\nmicrok8s.kubectl config get-contexts\n\n\nMake sure the current context is microk8s. If not, set it as the current context.\nmicrok8s.kubectl config use-context microk8s\n\n\n\n1.2 Docker\nDocker is deployed as part of the MicroK8s installation. The docker daemon used by MicroK8s is listening on unix:///var/snap/microk8s/current/docker.sock. You can access it with the microk8s.docker command.\n\nIf you require microk8s.docker to function as a standard docker command, you set an alias.\nsudo snap alias microk8s.docker docker\n\nUndo the alias;\nsudo snap unalias docker\n\n\nWe will apply the native microK8s commands by prefix commands microk8s.\nmicrok8s.docker ps\n\n\nContinue setup and configuration from the Kubernetes Dashboard section in the Mojaloop's deployment guide document.\n\n\n2. Useful Tips\n\nResolve problems with VSCode and kafka on ubuntu 18.04.

That's up to you. You are free (and encouraged!) to clone these repositories, participate in the community of developers, and contribute back to the code.\nWe are not trying to replace any mobile wallet or financial providers. We provide code to link together new and existing financial providers using a common scheme. There are central services for identifying a customer's provider, quoting, fulfillment, deferred net settlement, and shared fraud management. Each provider can take advantage of these services to send and receive money with others on the system and there's no cost to them to onboard new providers. We provide code for a simple example mobile money provider to show how integration can be done, but our example DFSP is not meant to be a production mobile money provider.\nRelated Projects\nThe Interledger Protocol Suite (ILP) is an open and secure standard that enables DFSPs to settle payments with minimal counter-party risk (the risk you incur when someone else is holding your money). With ILP, you can transact across different systems with no chance that someone in the middle disappears with your money. Mojaloop uses the Interledger Protocol Suite for the clearing layer. For an overview of how it works, see the Clearing Architecture Documentation.Where to I send bugs, questions, and feedback?\nUPDATE: For bugs, see Reporting bugs.\nTypes of Contributors\nThere are three types of contributors that we are targeting for this phase of the Mojaloop project.\nDevelopers or General Contributors\nThese individuals are those that want to start contributing to the Mojaloop community.

We also have included the recommendation links/versions for each of these tools.\nTOOL CHOICES\n\nAPI Development\nRAML and Swagger 2.0 is leveraged for API development.\nWSO2 offers an enterprise platform for integrating APIs, applications, and web services—locally and across the Internet. It also provides Mojaloop with a Security Layer, and Development Portal.\n\n\nCircle-CI - This tool is used for continuous build and continuous deployment. We needed an online continuous build and testing system that can work with many small projects and a distributed team. Jenkins was considered, but it requires hosting a server and a lot of configuration. CircleCI allowed for a no host solution that could be started with no cost and very limited configuration. We thought we might start with CircleCI and move off later if we outgrew it, but that hasn’t been needed.\nDactyl – We need to be able to print the online documentation. While it’s possible to print markdown files directly one at a time, we’d like to put the files into set of final PDF documents, where one page might end up in more than one final manual. Dactyl is a maintained open source conversion tool that converts between markdown and PDF. We originally tried Pandoc, but it had bugs with converting tables. Dactyl fixes that and is much more flexible.\nDBeaver - DBeaver is a free multi-platform database tool for developers, SQL programmers, database administrators and analysts. Supports all popular databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, SQLite, Oracle, DB2, SQL Server, Sybase, MS Access, Teradata, Firebird, Derby, etc.\nDocker - The Docker container engine creates and runs the Docker container from the Docker image file.\nDocker hub is used to link, build, test and push the Mojaloop code repositories. We needed to support both local and cloud execution. We have many small microservices that have very simple specific configurations and requirements. The easiest way to guarantee that the service works the same way in every environment from local development, to cloud, to hosted production is to put each microservice in a Docker container along with all the prerequisites it needs to run. The container becomes a secure, closed, pre-configured, runnable unit.\nDraw.io – We need to create pictures for our documents and architecture diagrams using an (ideally free) open source friendly tool, that is platform agnostic, supports vector and raster formats, allows WYSIWYG drawing, works with markdown, and is easy to use. We looked at many tools including: Visio, Mermaid, PlantUML, Sketchboard.io, LucidChart, Cacoo, Archi, and Google Drawings. Draw.io scored at the top for our needs. It’s free, maintained, easy to use, produces our formats, integrates with DropBox and GitHub, and platform agnostic. In order to save our diagrams, we have to save two copies – one in SVG (scalable vector) format and the other in PNG (raster). We use the PNG format within the docs since it can be viewed directly in GitHub. The SVG is used as the master copy as it is editable.\nESLint - Within JavaScript code, we use ESLint as a code style guide and style enforcement tool.\nGitHub – GitHub is a widely-used source code repository service, based on git, the standard source code version control system for open source projects. So the decision to use GitHub was straightforward. We create a story every time for integration work. Create bugs for any issues. Ensure all stories are tracked throughout the pipeline to ensure reliable metrics.\nHelm - The Helm package manager for Kubernetes provides templatized deployments and configurations and allow for overall complexity management.\nKafka - This technology is leveraged to support Mojaloop’s demand for a high velocity and high volume data messaging but keep our hardware requirements minimum.\nJavaScript - The Mojaloop application is primarily written in JavaScript.\nKubectl - This is a command line interface for running commands against Kubernetes clusters.\nKubernetes - This enterprise tool provides an extraction layer, infrastructure management and a container-orchestration system.\nMarkdown – Documentation is a deliverable for this project, just like the code, and so we want to treat it like the code in terms of versioning, review, check in, and tracking changes. We also want the documentation to be easily viewable online without constantly opening a viewer. GitHub has a built-in format called Markdown which solves this well. The same files work for the Wiki and the documents. They can be reviewed with the check in using the same tools and viewed directly in GitHub. We considered Google Docs, Word and PDF, but these binary formats aren’t easily diff-able. A disadvantage is that markdown only allows simple formatting – no complex tables or font changes - but this should be fine when our main purpose is clarity.\nMySQLWorkbench – MySQL Workbench is a unified visual tool for database architects, developers, and DBAs. MySQL Workbench provides data modeling, SQL development, and comprehensive administration tools for server configuration, user administration, backup, and much more. MySQL Workbench is available on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.\nNodeJS - This development tool is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that runs Mojaloop. NodeJS is designed to create simple microservices and it has a huge set of open source libraries available. Node performance is fine and while Node components don’t scale vertically a great deal, but we plan to scale horizontally, which it does fine. The original Interledger code was written in NodeJS as was the level one prototype. Most teams used Node already, so this made sense as a language. Within NodeJS code, we use Standard as a code style guide and to enforce code style.\nNPM - NPM is the package manager for Mojaloop since JavaScript is the default programming language.\nPercona for MySQL - These tools are leveraged as a relational database management system to ensure high performance and enterprise-grade functionality for the Mojaloop system. We needed a SQL backend that is open source friendly and can scale in a production environment. Thus, we chose MySQL, an open-source relational database management system.\nPostman is a Google Chrome application for interacting with HTTP APIs. It presents you with a friendly GUI for constructing requests and reading responses.\nRancher 2.0 - The Infrastructure management, provisioning and monitoring is provided by Rancher 2.0 which is an enterprise Kubernetes platform that manage Kubernetes deployments, clusters, on cloud & on-prem. Rancher makes it easy for DevOps teams to test, deploy and manage the Mojaloop system no matter where it is running.\nSlack – Slack is used for internal team communication. This was largely picked because several team already used it and liked it as a lightweight approach compared to email.\nSonarQube – We need an online dashboard of code quality (size, complexity, issues, and coverage) that can aggregate the code from all the repos. We looked at several online services (CodeCov, Coveralls, and Code Climate), but most couldn’t do complexity or even number of lines of code. Code Climate has limited complexity (through ESLint), but costs 6.67/seat/month. SonarQube is free, though it required us to setup and maintain our own server. It gave the P1 features we wanted.\nSourceTree – Sourcetree simplifies how you interact with your Git repositories so you can focus on coding. Visualize and manage your repositories through Sourcetree's simple Git GUI.\nStories On Board - We use Stories on Board to help capture our high level Epics at a portfolio level before they are commmitted and moved to Github. Our Story Board for Mojaloop is located here\nVisual Studio Code - Visual Studio Code is a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications. Visual Studio Code is free and available on your favorite platform - Linux, macOS, and Windows.\nZenHub – We needed a project management solution that was very light weight and cloud based to support distributed teams. It had to support epics, stories, and bugs and a basic project board. VS and Jira online offerings were both considered. For a small distributed development team an online service was better. For an open source project, we didn’t want ongoing maintenance costs of a server. Direct and strong GitHub integration was important. It was very useful to track work for each microservice with that microservice. Jira and VS both have more overhead than necessary for a project this size and don’t integrate as cleanly with GitHub as we’d want. ZenHub allowed us to start work immediately. A disadvantage is the lack of support for cumulative flow diagrams and support for tracking # of stories instead of points, so we do these manually with a spreadsheet updated daily and the results published to the \"Project Management\" Slack channel.\n\nTECHNOLOGY CHOICES\n\nAgile development - This methodology is used to track and run the project. The requirements need to be refined as the project is developed, therefore we picked agile development over waterfall or lean.\nAPIs - In order to avoid confusion from too many changing microservices, we use strongly defined APIs that conform to our Pragmatic REST design pattern. APIs will be defined using OpenAPI or RAML. Teams document their APIs with Swagger v2.0 or RAML v0.8 so they can automatically test, document, and share their work. Swagger is slightly preferred as there are free tools. Mule will make use of RAML 0.8. Swagger can be automatically converted to RAML v0.8, or manually to RAML v1.0 if additional readability is desired.\nAutomated Testing - For the most part, most testing will be automated to allow for easy regression. See the automated testing strategy and code quality metrics for standards.\nHosting - Mojaloop has been designed to be infrastructure agnostic and as such is supported by AWS, Azure and On-Premise installations.\nInterledger – Mojaloop needed a lightweight, open, and secure transport protocol for funds. Interledger.org provides all that. It also provides the ability to connect to other systems. We also considered block chain systems, but block chain systems send very large messages which will be harder to guarantee delivery of in third world infrastructure. Also, while blockchain systems provide good anonymity, that is not a project goal. To enable fraud detection, regulatory authorities need to be able to request records of transfers by account and person.\nOpen source - The entire project has been released as open source in accordance with the Level One Project principles. All tools and processes must be open source friendly and support projects that use an Apache 2.0 license with no restrictive licenses requirements on developers.\nOperating System – Microsoft Windows is widely used in many target countries, but we need an operating system that is free of license fees and is open source compatible. We are using Linux. We don’t have a dependency on the particular flavor, but are using the basic Amazon Linux. In the Docker containers, Alpine Linux is used.\nMicroservices - Because the architecture needs to easily deploy, scale, and have components be easily replaced or upgraded, it will be built as a set of microservices.\nScaled Agile Framework - There were four initial development teams that are geographically separate. To keep the initial phase of the project on track, the scaled agile framework (SAFe) was picked. This means work is divided into program increments (PI) that are typically four 2 week sprints long. As with the sprints, the PI has demo-able objective goals defined in each PI meeting.\nServices - Microservices are grouped and deployed in a few services such as the DFSP, Central Directory, etc. Each of these will have simple defined interfaces, configuration scripts, tests, and documentation.\nThreat Modeling, Resilience Modeling, and Health Modeling - Since the Mojallop code needs to exchange money in an environment with very flaky infrastructure it must have good security, resilience, and easily report it's health state and automatically attempt to return to it. \nUSSD - Smart phones are only 25% of the target market and not currently supported by most money transfer service, so we need a protocol that will work on simple feature phones. Like M-Pesa, we are using USSD between the phone and the digital financial service provider (DFSP).\n\n"},"contributors-guide/tools-and-technologies/pragmatic-rest.html":{"url":"contributors-guide/tools-and-technologies/pragmatic-rest.html","title":"Pragmatic REST","keywords":"","body":"Pragmatic REST\nPragmatic REST For the Mojaloop Project\nWith the emergence of API strategy as a scaling tool for Internet service businesses, the focus on interconnect technology has shifted. Building on the principles that enabled the Web to form and scale, REST (Representational State Transfer) has become a design preference for Internet service APIs. But while the REST principles, proposed in Roy Fielding's dissertation that defined them, have academic value as a basis for research, a pure REST design is not at present practical for most applications. We are advocating a kind of Pragmatic REST-a design pattern that adopts the beneficial components of RESTful design without requiring strict adherence to academic purity.\nThe Richardson Maturity Model\nMartin Fowler has referenced1 a structured model of RESTful adoption developed by Leonard Richardson and explained at a QCon talk. Fowler refers to this as the Richardson Maturity Model of RESTful design.\n\nMartin Fowler, referencing Rest in Practice,2 summarizes the genesis of RESTful design:\n\nuse Restful web services to handle many of the integration problems that enterprises face. At its heart . . . is the notion that the web is an existence proof of a massively scalable distributed system that works really well, and we can take ideas from that to build integrated systems more easily.\n\nA pragmatic approach to RESTful design uses the best parts of Fielding's conceptual framework to allow developers and integrators to understand what they can do with the API as rapidly as possible and without writing extraneous code.\nAt its most fundamental, a RESTful design is resource-centric and uses HTTP verbs. At its most advanced, a design that follows pure academic REST utilizes the HATEOAS principle by implementing Hypermedia Controls. We are advocating a Level 2 RESTful design for Mojaloop.\nWhy not Hypermedia Controls?\nAlthough HATEOAS is a fascinating principle-it advocates that a server should respond to each client action with a list of all possible actions that can lead the client to its next application state. And further, clients must not rely on out of band information (like a written API spec) for what actions can be performed on which resources or on the format of URIs.\nIt is this final proscription that fails the test of Pragmatic REST: While HATEOAS is an interesting theoretical approach to limit coupling, it does not easily apply to Mojaloop (or any other contract API design). When we take into account our audience for the interconnect APIs, we find a group of commercial entities that will be operating under a set of highly specific scheme rules. Interactions between the participants, and between participant and central service hub, will be highly specified to assign acceptable commercial risk that can be priced at very low cost to end-users. This requires ex-ante predictability of the API which is anathema to the HATEOAS principle defined by Fielding.\nPragmatic RESTful Principles\nURIs Define Resources\nA well-designed URI pattern makes an API easy to consume, discover, and extend, just as a carefully designed API does in a traditional programming language. Pure REST disdains this principle in favor of HATEOAS. But pragmatic REST follows a normal pattern for URI definitions to improve human understanding, even if HATEOAS principles are employed for discovery.\nURI paths that refer to a collection of objects should consist of a plural noun, e.g. /customers, to refer to a set of customers. When a collection can have only one instance, the singular noun should be used to avoid confusion. E.g. GET /transfers/:id/fulfillment is correct, since there is only one fulfillment object per identified transfer.\nURI paths that refer to a single object should consist of a plural noun (representing the collection), followed by a predefined unique identifier. E.g., /customers/123456 to refer to the specific customer with number 123456. The identifier must be unique within the containing collection and persist for the life of the object within that collection. IDs must not be ordinal values-ordinal retrieval of objects from a collection is possible using query parameters on the collection URI.\nURI paths may have a prefix to identify the environment, version, or other context of the resource. Nothing should follow the identifying path but collections and object references.\nURI path and query segment identifiers should be chosen from the Roman character set, [0-9A-Za-z]. Use camelCase to define the elements of the URI path. Do not use snake_case.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, \"_\" (underscore) and \"-\" (hyphen) should not be used in URI path or query segment identifiers.\nThis probably seems a bit parochial. The purpose is to find a well-defined URI format that is consistent with wide-spread practice, easy to define, predictable, and that maps to native environments and conventions. It isn't going to satisfy everyone. Here is reasoning behind this constraint:\nCapitalCase and camelCase are the defacto standard for NodeJS and JavaScript and are a common constraint in URI definition: URI path segments are often mapped to JS internal resources and so conforming to JS naming conventions makes sense.\nField names in JSON and SQL should also follow this convention since they are often automatically mapped into variable name space and can be referenced in URIs as path or query segment identifiers.\nWe should also avoid the use of \"$\" unless it is required by a library (e.g. JQuery). IBM JCL has passed away; let it rest in peace. There are better scope control tools to separate name spaces than introducing non-roman symbols.\nWe should avoid \"-\" (hyphen) in path segment and query parameter names as it does not map into variable names, SQL, or JSON field name identifiers.\nUnderscore characters must be escaped in markdown source by prefixing each with a \"\\\" character.\nSnake_case has been reported to be slightly easier to read than camelCase in variable names, but it actually does not improve readability of URIs, as it visually interferes with path and query segment delimiters making it difficult to visually parse them. And when URIs are underlined in presentation, the underscores become illegible.\nURI Parameters\nUse a standard and predictable set of optional parameters in a consistent way.\nA set of standard query parameters should be used for collections to enable caller control over how much of the collection they see. E.g. \"count\" to determine how many objects to return, \"start\" to determine where to start counting in the result set, and \"q\" as a generic free-form search query. We will define the standard set of parameters as we go and will apply them consistently.\nVerbs\nSingular objects should support GET for read, PUT for complete replacement (or creation when the primary key is specified by the client and is persistent, e.g. a payment card PAN), and DELETE for delete.\nCollections should support GET to read back the whole or part of a collection, and POST to add a new object to the collection.\nSingular objects may support POST as a way to change their state in specified ways. Posting a JSON document to a singular object URI may allow selected field values to be updated or trigger a state change or action without replacing the whole object.\nGET must be implemented in a nullipotent manner-that is, GET never causes side effects and never modifies client-visible system state (other than logging events or updating instrumentation, e.g.).\nPUT and DELETE must be implemented in an idempotent manner-that is, changes are applied consistently to the system data in a way that is dependent only on the state of the resource and inputs but on nothing else. The action has no additional effect if it is executed more than once with the same input parameters and does not depend on the order of other operations on a containing collection or other resources held in the collection. For example, removing a resource from a collection can be considered an idempotent operation on the collection. Using PUT to fully replace (or create) a uniquely identified resource when the URI is fully known to the client is also idempotent. This implies that the system may reorder operations to improve efficiency, and the client does not need to know whether a resource exists before attempting to replace it.\nPOST and PATCH3 are not idempotent operations. POST is used to create new resources where the resource identifier is assigned by the server or where a single identified internal resource is implied by the target URI (e.g. POST /transfers, but PUT /transfers/:id/fulfillment).\nData Format\nWe favor JSON4 related data formats over XML. In some cases, data formats will be binary or XML, as defined by pre-existing standards, and these will be precisely specified. Binary formats should have a formal syntax to avoid ambiguous representational translations (e.g. character set translations, big- or little-endian representations of numeric values, etc).\nDate and time values used in APIs should comply to the ISO 8601 standard, and further profiled by the w3c Note on Date and Time Formats.5 This w3c note should lead to the reduction in complexity and error scope of communicating components that must exchange tangible dates and times. There will be cases where we use non-ISO format date or time as required by an external standard, e.g. ISO 7813 expiry dates.\nExisting standard XML formats should have an XSD schema for the acceptable subset profile used within the project. For particularly complex data formats, we may use a common format profile translator to map between our project subset of the standard format and the wire format used by a standardized protocol (e.g.). This will limit coupling to complex formats in a more maintainable way.\nWhen specifying the PATCH action for a resource, we will use a consistent patch document format (e.g. JSON Patch6).\nReturn Codes\nUse HTTP return codes in a consistent way and according to their standard definitions. The standard codes are defined in RFC 2616.7\nMachine Readable Error Format\nThe API should provide a machine readable error result in a well-defined JSON format. {TBD whether to use a response envelope and how to format errors, faults, and success envelopes. RESTful design relies on headers to carry protocol-defined errors, debug info can also be carried in headers. We should be clear on why we are using an envelope and how this supports normal production communication between client and server.\nVersioning\nAPI URIs should include a version identifier in the format vM as a leading path element (where \"M\" is the Major component of the multi-part version number). The API and its version identifier element must conform to the semantic versioning8 2.0 specification for API versioning.\nA client must specify the Major version number in each request. It is not possible for a client to express a requirement for a specific minor version.\nThe full API version number is specified in the response header (TBD) for all successful and error responses.\nWhile an API version contract will be influenced by Major, minor, and patch levels, only the Major version number is a production API binding element-that is, a production client cannot request a particular minor version or patch level and a production server will not accept a URI request that specifies these extra elements.\nHowever, in pre-production environments, it is anticipated that some combination of minor, patch, pre-release, and metadata suffixes would be supported in client requests (as defined in semver [3]) and may be expressed in pre-production URIs to assist with development and integration scenarios.\nWe May Need to Give REST a Rest\nAs we design the interconnection APIs between components and between participating systems, we may find API requirements that don't precisely match the Pragmatic REST pattern defined here. We will evaluate these case-by-case and make the best choice to support the project goals.\nNon-Functional Requirements\nAs we develop the APIs, we will make consistent choices about non-functional requirements to reinforce the project goals.\n1: http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html, retrieved August 18, 2016.\n2: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596805829, retrieved August 18, 2016.\n3: RFC 5789, PATCH Method for HTTP, https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789, retrieved August 18, 2016.\n4: Introducing JSON, http://json.org/, retrieved August 18, 2016.\n5: http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/NOTE-datetime-19980827, retrieved August 22, 2016.\n6: JSON Patch, http://jsonpatch.com/, retrieved August 18, 2016.\n7: https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html\n8: Semantic Versioning 2.0.0, http://semver.org/, retrieved August 18, 2016.\n"},"contributors-guide/tools-and-technologies/code-quality-metrics.html":{"url":"contributors-guide/tools-and-technologies/code-quality-metrics.html","title":"Code Quality Metrics","keywords":"","body":"Code Quality Metrics\nFunctional quality metrics\nUnit test metrics\nHigh coverage and low dependencies show that the code is testable and therefore well isolated and easy to maintain.

The following are foundation-specific guidelines which have been updated and slightly modified.\nAcronyms\nSpell out all acronyms on first reference. Include the acronym in parentheses immediately after the full spelling only if you refer to it again in the document. Example: Kofi Annan, chairman of the board of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), traveled to Nairobi this month. It was his first visit to the AGRA office.\nAmpersand\nOnly use an ampersand (&) when it's part of a formal name like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In all other cases, spell out and.\nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation\nOur formal legal name is the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Use it on first reference. Always use the ampersand (&) and always capitalize Foundation when Bill & Melinda Gates comes before it.\nNever abbreviate the foundation's name as BMGF.\nNever translate the foundation name into other languages, as it is a proper noun. The one exception to this is when translating the foundation's name into Chinese, in which case translation is acceptable.\nDo not capitalize foundation when the word stands alone. Example: The foundation's new headquarters will be built near Seattle Center.\nUse Gates Foundation only if you are sure the context makes the foundation's identity clear. There is a Gates Family Foundation in Colorado, so we need to be careful. Example: The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Ford Foundation co-sponsored the event. A Gates Foundation staff member gave closing remarks.\nThe entity that manages the endowment is formally and legally known as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust. You will not need to refer to this entity often, but when you do, write it out on first reference and refer to it as the asset trust thereafter.\nBold and colons\nFrequently I see structures (like in this very comment!) where you have introductory terms or phrases that are bolded and set apart from the contents with a colon. Should the colon also be bolded, or not? (I frequently see it done both ways.)\nBuffett\nNote the spelling: two fs and two ts (i.e., Warren Buffett).\nBulleted lists\nIntroduce bulleted lists with a colon when the listed items complete the lead-in sentence or phrase. Exception: never use colons in headings or subheadings to introduce bulleted lists.\nCapitalize the first words of and use periods with listed items only if they are full sentences. Examples:\n\nThis is a complete sentence.\nnot a complete sentence\n\nNever link items in a bulleted list with coordinating conjunctions and punctuation (semicolons or commas) as you would in a sentence-style list. In other words, never do:\n\nthis,\nthat, or\nthe other thing.\n\nCaptions\nCaption photos whenever possible. It helps people understand our work.\nWrite captions as single gerund (ing verb) phrases, followed by the city, state or country, and year the photo was taken in parentheses. Example: A doctor preparing a vaccine for delivery (Brazzaville, Congo, 2007)._\nWhen writing a caption, be sure to introduce the people featured and explain what's happening in the image as it relates to our areas of focus. Be as brief as possible so you don't distract from the image or layout. Avoid verbs that state the obvious about what the photo's subject is doing (e.g., smiling, standing, and so on).\nIf one of the co-chairs appears in a photo with other people, be sure to identify the co-chair in the caption. Don't assume everyone knows what our co-chairs look like.\nCitations\nMost fields have their own citation conventions. Adopt those used by the field in question. When citation conventions are unavailable or uncertain, follow The Chicago Manual of Style.\nWhen a document uses both footnotes and endnotes, for the footnotes, use the following symbols:\n\n1st note = * (asterisk)\n2nd note = † (dagger)\n3rd note = ‡ (double dagger)\n4th note = § (section sign)\n5th note = ** (2 asterisks)\n6th note = †† (2 daggers)\n7th note = ‡‡ (2 double daggers)\n8th note = §§ (2 section signs) \n\nSeparate multiple superscript references (footnotes, endnotes) with commas, not semicolons.\nClinical trials\nUse Roman numerals when referring to clinical trial phases and always capitalize Phase. Example: The company will begin Phase III trials on the new drug this spring.\nContact information\nUse periods to separate parts of phone numbers, and begin each number with a plus sign.\nBecause we work with people throughout the world, omit the international access code, which differs from country to country (it's 011 in the United States). Examples: +1.206.709.3100 (United States) +91.11.4100.3100 (India)\nCopyright and trademark notice\nAll publications, media, and materials produced by or for the foundation should contain the notice shown below. The Legal team must approve all exceptions.\n © (year) Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. All Rights Reserved. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is a registered trademark in the United States and other countries.\nWhen possible, begin the trademark portion of the notice on a separate line.\nDashes\nUse dashes—those the width of a capital M—to indicate asides or abrupt changes in thought. Use en dashes—those the width of a capital N—with numerical ranges.\nDo not include a space before or after a dash.\nExamples: We work to make safe, affordable financial services—particularly savings accounts—more widely available to people in developing countries.\nIn the 2004 presidential election, 76 percent of U.S. college graduates ages 25-44 voted.\nDollars ($)\nIn Global Health and Global Development materials, because more than a dozen countries use dollars, specify U.S. dollars in parentheses on first mention in a document. Example: $100,000 (U.S.). Omit the parenthetical U.S. in subsequent references to dollar amounts in the same document.\nFoundation program names\nWe have three programs: Global Development Program, Global Health Program, and United States Program.\nProgram is capitalized when used with the full name (Global Development Program), but not when used alone (The program makes grants in several areas.).\nUse periods when abbreviating the name of the United States Program: U.S. Program.\nGH, GD, and USP are fine for internal use, but inappropriate for external publications.\nGates family\nWilliam Gates III is formally referred to as Bill Gates. In internal documents, use Bill—not a nickname or abbreviation.\nUse Melinda Gates when formally referring to Melinda.\nUse William H. Gates Sr. when formally referring to Bill Gates Sr. There is no comma between Gates and Sr. Bill Sr. is acceptable in internal documents.\nPlural: Gateses. Do not use an apostrophe to form the plural of the family's name. Example: The Gateses attended the opening of the new University of Washington law building.\nPossessive: The apostrophe follows Gates when you refer to something owned by either Bill or Melinda. Example: Melinda Gates' speech was well received. The apostrophe follows Gateses when you refer to something Bill and Melinda own jointly. Example: The Gateses' decision to provide free Internet access in U.S. public libraries has increased library usage and circulation overall.\nYou may also phrase it this way: Bill and Melinda Gates' decision to provide free Internet access …\nSee the Titles of people entry for the formal titles of Bill, Melinda, Bill Sr., and other leaders of the foundation.\nHyphens\nThere are few hard-and-fast rules when it comes to hyphens. Generally we use them to enhance the reader's understanding.\nExamples: When writing for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, use real-world poverty examples to illustrate your point. When writing for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, use real world-poverty examples to illustrate your point.\nIn the first example, the hyphen in real-world connects real and world to form a single adjective describing poverty. In the second example, the hyphen in world-poverty connects world and poverty to form a single adjective describing examples.\nThe meaning changes depending on the placement of the hyphen. In instances where a series of adjectives creates ambiguity about what they refer to, use a hyphen to clarify the intended meaning.\nWhen capitalizing hyphenated words, only capitalize the first part. Example: Co-chairs Bill and Melinda Gates.\nFor other uses of hyphens—compound modifiers, prefixes and suffixes, fractions—refer to the Associated Press Stylebook.\nNumerals\nWhen referring to dollar figures, spell out million and billion. Use figures and decimals (not fractions). Do not go beyond two decimal places. Example: The foundation granted .45 million to United Way.\nWhen using numbers that have nothing to do with dollar figures or percentages, write them out if they are under 10, and use numerals if they are 10 or over. Example: Four program officers went on 13 site visits.\nIn cases of grammatical parallelism, parallel construction always trumps this rule. For instance: Mr. Johnson has two children, 5-year-old Kyle and 13-year-old Frances.\nNever begin a sentence with a numeral. Either spell the number out or revise the sentence so it doesn't begin with a number.\nPercentages\nWhen using percentages, write out percent (don't use %). Use numerals instead of writing numbers out, even if they're less than 10.\nExample: This program accounts for 6 percent of our grantmaking.\nPhotographer credits\nIf the foundation owns the image you are using, you don't need to credit the photographer. All images in our media asset management system are foundation-owned. If the foundation has purchased a license to use the image, you may need to credit the photographer. If you have questions about photo credit requirements, contact the Foundation Communications Service Desk.\nPlain language\nWe could call out a few specific constructions that are needlessly wordy. One that we frequently catch at Ripple is \"in order to\" instead of just \"to.\"\nQuotation marks\nUse double quotation marks for dialogue and the citation of printed sources. Limit use of scare quotes—quotation marks meant to call attention to a quoted word or phrase and distance the author from its meaning, typically because the language is specialized, idiomatic, ironic, or misused. Example: The foundation has increasingly used “program-related investments” in recent years.\nQuoted strings and punctuation\nWhen describing exact strings in technical documentation, should punctuation (not part of the literal strings) be included in the quotation marks? For example, valid states include \"pending,\" \"in progress,\" and \"completed.\"\nScientific names\nCapitalize and italicize scientific names in accordance with conventions in the scientific community. Use the full version of a scientific name on first mention and the abbreviated form thereafter. For example, use Salmonella typhi first and S. typhi for each additional reference.\nSerial commas\nWith lists of three or more items in a sentence, add a final comma before the coordinating conjunction and or or. Example: The foundation's three program areas are Global Development, Global Health, and the United States.\nSpacing after punctuation\nUse only one space after punctuation, including periods, colons, and semicolons.\nSpelling and capitalization conventions\nbed net: two words, no hyphen.\nemail: one word, no hyphen, lowercase.\nfoundation: lowercase, except as part of the full foundation name.\ngrantmaking: one word, no hyphen.\nnongovernmental: one word, no hyphen.\nnonprofit: one word, no hyphen.\npostsecondary: one word, no hyphen.\nWashington state: lowercase state (unless you're referring to Washington State University, the Washington State Legislature, or something similar).\nwebsite: one word, lowercase\nTitles of people\nFormal titles should not be capitalized unless the title precedes a person's name or appears in a headline. Example: Co-chair Melinda Gates will speak at the Washington Economic Club this year.\nLowercase and spell out titles when they are not used with an individual's name. Example: The foundation co-chair issued a statement.\nLowercase and spell out titles in constructions that use commas to set them off from a name. Example: Bill Gates, co-chair of the foundation, commented on the grant.\nUnited States\nSpell out United States when using it as a noun. Abbreviate it as U.S. (including periods) when using it as an adjective. In certain cases, as when referring to a person from the United States, it's acceptable to use American.\nExamples: The U.S. State Department is in the United States. The foundation's U.S. Program…\nURL\nReference web addresses without the http:// as follows: www.gatesfoundation.org\n"},"contributors-guide/frequently-asked-questions.html":{"url":"contributors-guide/frequently-asked-questions.html","title":"Frequently Asked Questions","keywords":"","body":"Frequently Asked Questions\nWhat is Mojaloop? Mojaloop is open-source software for building interoperable digital payments platforms on a national scale. It makes it easy for different kinds of providers to link up their services and deploy low-cost financial services in new markets.\nHow does it work? Most digital financial providers run on their own networks, which prevents customers who use different services from transacting with each other. Mojaloop functions like a universal switchboard, routing payments securely between all customers, regardless of which network they're on. It consists of three primary layers, each with a specific function: an interoperability layer, which connects bank accounts, mobile money wallets, and merchants in an open loop; a directory service layer, which navigates the different methods that providers use to identify accounts on each side of a transaction; a transactions settlement layer, which makes payments instant and irrevocable; and components which protect against fraud.\nWho is it for? There are many components to the code, and everyone either directly or indirectly working with digital financial transactions-fintech developers, bankers, entrepreneurs, startups-is invited to explore and use whatever parts are useful or appealing. The software as a whole is meant to be implemented on a national scale, and so it will be most applicable to mobile money providers, payments associations, central banks, and country regulators.\nDevelopers at fintech and financial services companies can use the code in three ways: adapt the code to the financial services standards for a country, use the code to update their own products and services or create new ones, and improve the code by proposing updates and new versions of it for other users.\nFor example:\n\nA central bank may commission the use of the software by their commercial partners to speed up the deployment of a national payment gateway.\nA major payment processor can use the software to modernize their current offering, to achieve lower transaction costs without major R&D investments.\nA fintech startup can use the code to understand practically how to comply with interoperable payment APIs.\nA bank can use the code to modify their internal systems so that they easily interoperate with other payment providers.\n\nWhy does it exist? Providers trying to reach developing markets with innovative, low-cost digital financial services have to build everything on their own. This raises costs and segregates services from each other. Mojaloop can be used as a foundation to help build interoperable platforms, lowering costs for providers and allowing them to integrate their services with others in the market.\nWho's behind it? Mojaloop was built in collaboration with a group of leading tech and fintech companies: Ripple, Dwolla, Software Group, ModusBox and Crosslake Technologies. Mojaloop was created by the Gates Foundation's Mojaloop, which is aimed at leveling the economic playing field by crowding in expertise and resources to build inclusive payment models to benefit the world's poor. It is free to the public as open-source software under the Apache 2.0 License.\nWhat platforms does Mojaloop run on? The Mojaloop platform was developed for modern cloud-computing environments. Open-source methods and widely used platforms, like Node.js, serve as the foundation layer for Mojaloop. The microservices are packaged in Docker and can be deployed to local hardware or to cloud computing environments like Amazon Web Services or Azure.\nIs it really open-source? Yes. All core modules, documentation and white papers are available under a Apache 2.0 License. Mojaloop relies on commonly used open-source software, including node.js, MuleCE, Java and PostgreSQL. Mojaloop also uses the Interledger Protocol to choreograph secure money transfers. The licenses for all of these platforms and their imported dependencies allow for many viable uses of the software.\nHow can I contribute to Mojaloop? You can contribute by helping us create new functionality on our roadmap or by helping us improve the platform. For our roadmap, go to the Mojaloop Roadmap. We recommend starting with the onboarding guide and sample problem. This has been designed by the team to introduce the core ideas of the platform and software, the build methods, and our process for check-ins.\nWhat is supported? Currently the Central ledger components are supported by the team. The DFSP components are outdated and thus the end-to-end environment and full setup is challenging to install.\n"},"mojaloop-technical-overview/":{"url":"mojaloop-technical-overview/","title":"Mojaloop Technical Overview","keywords":"","body":"Mojaloop Technical Overview\nMojaloop Services\nThe basic idea behind Mojaloop is that we need to connect multiple Digital Financial Services Providers (DFSPs) together into a competitive and interoperable network in order to maximize opportunities for poor people to get access to financial services with low or no fees. We don't want a single monopoly power in control of all payments in a country, or a system that shuts out new players. It also doesn't help if there are too many isolated subnetworks. The following diagrams shows the Mojaloop interconnects between DFSPs and the Mojaloop Hub (schema implementation example) for a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Transfer:\nMojaloop addresses these issues in several key ways:\n\nA set of central services provides a hub through which money can flow from one DFSP to another. This is similar to how money moves through a central bank or clearing house in developed countries. Besides a central ledger, central services can provide identity lookup, fraud management, and enforce scheme rules.\nA standard set of interfaces a DFSP can implement to connect to the system, and example code that shows how to use the system. A DFSP that wants to connect up can adapt our example code or implement the standard interfaces into their own software. The goal is for it to be as straightforward as possible for a DFSP to connect to the interoperable network.\nComplete working open-source implementations of both sides of the interfaces - an example DFSP that can send and receive payments and the client that an existing DFSP could host to connect to the network.\n\n\nThe Mojaloop Hub is the primary container and reference we use to describe the Mojaloop echo-system which is split in to the following domains:\n\nMojaloop Open Source Services - Core Mojaloop Open Source Software (OSS) that has been supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in partnership with the Open Source Community.\nMojaloop Hub - Overall Mojaloop reference (and customizable) implementation for Hub Operators is based on the above OSS solution.\n\n"},"mojaloop-technical-overview/mojaloop-components.html":{"url":"mojaloop-technical-overview/mojaloop-components.html","title":"Mojaloop Hub","keywords":"","body":"Mojaloop Hub\nThere are several components that make up the Mojaloop ecosystem.

This is similar to how money moves through a central bank or clearing house in developed countries. The Central Services contains the core Central Ledger logic to move money but also will be extended to provide fraud management and enforce scheme rules.\nThe Account Lookup Service (ALS) provides mechanism to resolve FSP routing information through the Particpant API or orchestrate a Party request based on an internal Participant look-up. The internal Participant look-up is handled by a number of standard Oracle adapter or services. Example Oracle adapter/service would be to look-up Participant information from Pathfinder or a Merchant Registry. These Oracle adapter or services can easily be added depending on the schema requirements.\n\nOn either side of the Mojaloop Hub there is sample open source code to show how a DFSP can send and receive payments and the client that an existing DFSP could host to connect to the network.\n"},"mojaloop-technical-overview/central-ledger/":{"url":"mojaloop-technical-overview/central-ledger/","title":"Central-Ledger Services","keywords":"","body":"Central-Ledger Services\nThe central ledger is a series of services that facilitate clearing and settlement of transfers between DFSPs, including the following functions:\n\nBrokering real-time messaging for funds clearing\nMaintaining net positions for a deferred net settlement\nPropagating scheme-level and off-transfer fees\n\n\n"},"mojaloop-technical-overview/account-lookup-service/":{"url":"mojaloop-technical-overview/account-lookup-service/","title":"Account-Lookup Service","keywords":"","body":"Account Lookup Service\nThe Account Lookup Service (ALS) (refer to section 6.2.1.2) as per the Mojaloop v1.0 Specification implements the following use-cases:\n\nParticipant Look-up \nParty Look-up\nManage Participants Registry information\nAdding Participant Registry information\nDeleting Participant Registry information\n\n\n\nUse-cases that have been implemented over and above for Hub Operational use: \n\nAdmin Operations\nManage Oracle End-point Routing information\nManage Switch End-point Routing information\n\n\n\n1. Design Considerations\n1.1 Account Lookup Service (ALS)\nThe ALS design provides a generic Central-Service component as part of the core Mojaloop. The purpose of this component is to provide routing and alignment to the Mojaloop API Specification. This component will support multiple Look-up registries (Oracles). This ALS will provide an Admin API to configure routing/config for each of the Oracles similiar to the Central-Service API for the End-point configuration for DFSP routing by the Notification-Handler (ML-API-Adapter Component). The ALS will in all intense purpose be a switch with a persistence store for the storage/management of the routing rules/config.\n1.1.1 Assumptions\n\nThe ALS design will only cater for a single switch for the time being.\nSupport for multiple switches will utilise the same DNS resolution mechanism that is being developed for the Cross Border/Network design.\n\n1.1.2 Routing\nThe routing configuration will be based on the following:\n\nPartyIdType - See section 7.5.6 of the Mojaloop Specification\nCurrency - See section 7.5.5 of the Mojaloop Specification. Currency code defined in ISO 4217 as three-letter alphabetic string. This will be optional, however isDefault indicator must be set to true if the Currency is not provided.\nisDefault - Indicator that a specific Oracle is the default provider for a specific PartyIdType. Note that there can be many default Oracles, but there can only be a single Oracle default for a specific PartyIdType. The default Oracle for a specific PartyIdType will only be selected if the originating request does not include a Currency filter.\n\n1.2 ALS Oracle\nThe ALS Oracle be implemented as either a Service or Adapter (semantic dependant on use - Mediation = Adapter, Service = Implementation) will provide a look-up registry component with similar functionality of the /participants Mojaloop API resources. It has however loosely based on the ML API specification as it's interface implements a sync pattern which reduces the correlation/persistence requirements of the Async Callback pattern implemented directly by the ML API Spec. This will provide all ALS Oracle Services/Adapters with a standard interface which will be mediated by the ALS based on its routing configuration.This component (or back-end systems) will also be responsible for the persistence & defaulting of the Participant details.\n2.

Overview","keywords":"","body":"Mojaloop Overview\n\n\n\nMojaloop is open source software for creating digital payments platforms that connect all customers, merchants, banks, and other financial providers in a country's economy. Rather than a financial product or application in itself, Mojaloop establishes a blueprint for technology that bridges all the financial products and applications in any given market.\nThe basic idea behind Mojaloop is that we need to connect multiple Digital Financial Services Providers (DFSPs) together into a competitive and interoperable network in order to maximize opportunities for poor people to get access to financial services with low or no fees. We don't want a single monopoly power in control of all payments in a country, or a system that shuts out new players. It also doesn't help if there are too many isolated subnetworks.\n\nOur model addresses these issues in several key ways:\n\nA set of central services provides a hub through which money can flow from one DFSP to another. This is similar to how money moves through a central bank or clearing house in developed countries. Besides a central ledger, central services can provide identity lookup, fraud management, and enforce scheme rules.\nA standard set of interfaces a DFSP can implement to connect to the system, and example code that shows how to use the system. A DFSP that wants to connect up can adapt our example code or implement the standard interfaces into their own software. The goal is for it to be as straightforward as possible for a DFSP to connect to the interoperable network.\nComplete working open-source implementations of both sides of the interfaces - an example DFSP that can send and receive payments and the client that an existing DFSP could host to connect to the network.\n\nThe intention for the Mojaloop project is for financial institutions and commercial providers to use the open-source software to help build digital, interoperable payments platforms that drive financial inclusion on a national scale. Specifically, the platforms will enable seamless, low-cost transactions between individual users, merchants, banks, providers, and even government offices - helping connect poor customers with everyone else in the digital economy.\n"},"mojaloop-background/":{"url":"mojaloop-background/","title":"Mojaloop Background","keywords":"","body":"Mojaloop Background\nMojaloop Background\nMojaloop grew out of principles set forth by the Financial Services for the Poor team at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. These principles form the cornerstone of the Level One Project, which is the foundation's initiative for designing and implementing digital financial services and systems to include and benefit the world's 2 billion unbanked. The code won't address the gap in digital financial services on its own, but it can help service providers open markets and accelerate progress.\nDigital and mobile technologies make it possible to reach new customers in developing markets with innovative, low-cost financial services. The lack of a shared platform, though, means that financial providers have to build everything on their own. This raises costs and keeps the digital financial industry from growing and innovating as fast as it could.\nWith support and funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Mojaloop was designed by a team of leading tech and fintech companies: Ripple, Dwolla, ModusBox, Software Group, Coil, and Crosslake Technologies.

There are several different paths for each of these scenarios, including potential timeout issues and reversals (which are handled as a separate transaction). The most common paths include:\n\nSend money to anyone\nBuy goods\nBulk Payments\nTier Risk Levels\nFraud Checks and Blacklists\nAccount Management\nCheck Account and POS\n\nScenario Descriptions\nSend money to anyone\nHamim is working on his farm in Northern Uganda when he receives an urgent phone call from his brother, Kani. Kani is low on money and will not get paid until next week. Kani has no money to pay for food for his family and asks Hamim to help him out. Hamim and Kani have no means of transportation and it would take several days for Hamim to get to his Kani's home in Southern Uganda. While they both have mobile flip phones, they use different financial service providers. Kani tells Hamim that he needs 5,000 shillings to buy food until he gets paid next week for his job working in a local field. Hamin agrees to send Kani the money.\n        *** Mojaloop technology does its job ***\n\nBecause Hamim has sent money to Kani before he has his information on his phone. Hamim sees Kani's name come up on his phone and he starts the transaction. He also sees the total fees and any exchange rates he has to pay before he sends the money. He is happy for that validation and that the transaction goes the same way every time. In under 30 seconds, Hamim is able to send the money to his Kani and verifies that he got it. Hamim is happy he was able to help out Kani and his family so quickly so they can buy food.\nBuy Goods\nVenya is waiting in line to buy plantains at her local market. She is corralling her elder child with one hand and has her baby in a sling. She often comes to this seller and she knows he has a good price. She also knows that even though she carries no money and he is not on her financial network, she can buy from him. As she approaches the head of the line she juggles the children and pulls out a simple flip phone. She tells him 1.5 kilograms and he tells her the price, which she agrees to.\n        *** Mojaloop technology does its job ***\n\nBecause she's been here before the merchant already has her information on his phone. The only information he has is her user number. This makes Venya feel safe that the merchant does not have her mobile phone number. The merchant enters in the amount for the plantains. Almost instantaneously, Venya sees the merchants invoice on her phone and she is glad she is able to pay for the transaction using her mWallet account. She is happy that the transaction goes the same way every time, because half of her attention is on the children. She has friends who can't read and they are able to buy things this way too by following the simple order of the transaction. In under 30 seconds, she is able to send the money to the merchant and both Venya and the merchant get confirmation of the transaction. She tells the elder child to pick up her plantains and makes room for the next person in line.\nBulk Payments\nNikisha is the accountant for one of the largest manufacturing companies in Johannesburg and employs over 250 workers. Their company uses a time and attendance system to track the number of hours that each employee works along with their hourly rate and employee ID. On a weekly basis Nikisha gets an update on her bulk payment system that shows all the employees, their user ID along and amount to be paid. Since the companies employees all have different financial service providers this system makes it really easy for Nikisha to confirm and distribute their pay with a couple of clicks. The company has a high turnover rate so new employees who get their first paycheck are automatically prompted to open an account as long as they provided a valid mobile number when they started. As Nikisha gets ready to send out this week's payments she opens up a bulk payment report.\n*** Mojaloop technology does its job ***\n\nThe bulk report for payments comes up by date range and, since Nikisha does this weekly, there are several items she needs to verify each time. Specifically, she looks for any errors or alerts for employees with invalid phone numbers, names not matching or other anomalies. Nikisha has the ability to follow-up with her co-workers or employees directly to fix these errors before sending out the payments. In addition, Nikisha is also notified of any employees who don't have an account setup. For these users, Nikisha is still able to push a payment through and the employee will be prompted by text message to open an account. Nikisha is thankful she has this process that makes it much easier to distribute funds. Once Nikisha has completed her validation, she sends it to her supervisor for final approval. Nikisha is glad to have this system in place because several years ago, Nikisha and her supervisor had to pay employees in cash and use a manual system to verify payments were received which made her feel very uneasy.\nTier Risk Levels\nSalem works as an auditor for a large bank in Kampala, Uganda. His job is to monitor, manage and reduce risk for the company. order to do so each new user ID in the system is assigned a default tier level which means they can only transfer a small number and amount of funds in and out of the system over specific periods of time. As users acquire greater balances in their accounts and hold their accounts for longer periods of time their tier levels improve. Tier levels are handled automatically by the system so Salem does not need to worry about assigning or changing these levels under normal circumstances. Part of Salem's job as an auditor is to review the daily reports to ensure that everyone's funds are safe and secure and he kicks off his daily report to review the accounts.\n*** Mojaloop technology does its job ***\n\nThis morning when Salem reviews these reports he notices that one specific user ID has 32 outgoing transactions in one day which exceeds their daily count of 25. This seems very suspicious to Salem and he goes ahead and contacts the customer. It turns out that this customer is a local merchant that owns a store. The merchant explains that he has to go to the market on a weekly basis to get ingredients for his restaurant and it is not uncommon for him and his staff to make more than 25 purchases in one day. Although this customer has only been with Salem's bank for a month then have a healthy balance in their account. Salem goes ahead and upgrades the customers tier level to increase the daily and weekly transaction counts.\nFraud Checks and Blacklists\nSalem works as an auditor for a large bank in Kampala, Uganda. His job is to monitor and stop any fraudulent activity for the company. While the company has a set of rules that might flag individuals for Salem to investigate, he also has the authority to screen any user ID for fraudulent activities at any time. Each time Salem performs a fraud check on a user ID, the system records the date of the last check along with any comments that Salem might have made. This makes it very easy for Salem to search for IDs that might have never been checked for fraud or have not been checked in a very long time. Salem has been monitoring one particular ID that seems to have had an increased amount of incoming funds deposited into their account on a daily basis. Today he does a search of the user ID to investigate further.\n*** Mojaloop technology does its job ***\n\nWhen the user ID is retrieved Salem is able to see the customer's name, birthdate and national ID number. He also sees any additional IDs and the account type associated with this customer. Upon further inspection Salem sees once again the number and amount of transactions deposited into this account has doubled again today. Salem suspects that this user is involved in some illegal activity and would like to send this up to his supervisor to get someone to do a deeper investigation. In the meantime to ensure that the illegal funds don't continue to come into the system, Salem decides to 'freeze' the account. Salem does this by checking the blacklist button and indicating a reason for the blacklist. At this point any future deposits or withdrawals for this User ID will be denied until someone from the Bank removes them from the blacklist. Salem feels good that no additional funds that might of come from illegal or unapproved sources will be deposited into this customer account.\nAccount Management\nTadeo just bought his first mobile flip phone for him and his family to share. He is happy that he finally has a phone that he can use in emergencies, but he can also finally keep his money secure by opening up a bank account. Tadeo has never had a bank account since he lives in a very remote part of Africa with no personal means of transportation. Tadeo and his family have to rely on bartering or cash to buy any goods they need at the market. Although Tadeo is not proficient in reading, he is able to easily use his phone to setup and account for him and his family by following a couple of easy to read menu steps.\n*** Mojaloop technology does its job ***\n\nTadeo was able to use his phone to create an mWallet account using his National ID. He was also asked to create a unique pin which made him feel secure in case him or someone in the family lost the phone. Tadeo is the primary account owner and he was able to easily create a new account for his oldest son. He was very pleased that he could have separate accounts for his son. His son is married and lives with Tadeo but does not have a phone. Since his son works it is only fair that they should be able to spend his money on goods and foods that he and his wife prefer. Tadeo also adds his wife as a user on his account. He allows his wife to be a signatory since she does most of the shopping at the local market and now has the ability to pay for goods using this phone. Tadeo is very happy that his wife no longer needs to have cash or carry barter goods to the market.\nCheck Account and POS\nJahari has a flip phone that all the family uses and he has setup different user numbers for each family member. Jahari is at the local market and needs to buy some meat for his family. Before he does, he wants to make sure he has enough funds in his account to purchase the goods and still have enough left over to set aside for future medical expenses and education. Jahari is happy that his money is secure and he is able to check his account balance anytime he needs to by simply entering his secure pin on his phone. Once he confirms his balance he will buy some goat and cow meat at the market.\n    *** Mojaloop technology does its job ***\n\nAfter Jahari has entered his pin on his phone he is able to see his account balance. He is also able to see any of his recent transactions as well as any fees that were associated with these transactions. After confirming his available funds he picks out his meat and brings it up to the merchant for payment. The merchant does a lot of business in this market and has a point of sales device. This is very helpful for Jahari and his family since they only have one phone and many times his wife or his children go to the market and do not have the phone with them. Jahari can generate a one time pin for family to use in these cases. The merchant is able to enter the purchase amount on the POS device and Jahari or any of his family members securely enters their user number and reviews the transaction. He confirms that the amount on the POS machine matches what the merchant verbally told him and he enters his one-time pin to approve the transaction.\n*** Mojaloop technology does its job ***\n\nThe merchant gets confirmation that he received payment and he prints a receipt for Jahari. Jahari also receives a text notification on his phone confirming the transaction has completed and including the transaction details. And since Jahari has his phone with him today he also re-checks his account balance again to confirm that appropriate funds were taken from his account. Jahari is happy that this is an easy process and he can see that he has plenty of money left to set aside this month for his family to use on education or health expenses.\n"},"mojaloop-background/level-one-principles.html":{"url":"mojaloop-background/level-one-principles.html","title":"Level One Principles","keywords":"","body":"Level One Principles\nThe Level One Project Guide outlines a vision of how an inclusive digital financial services system can work for the benefit of poor people.

Kubernetes\nThis section will guide the reader through the deployment process to setup Kubernetes.\nIf you are new to Kubernetes it is strongly recommended to familiarize yourself with Kubernetes. Kubernetes Concepts is a good place to start and will provide an overview.\nThe following are Kubernetes concepts used within the project. An understanding of these concepts is imperative before attempting the deployment;\n\nDeployment\nPod\nReplicaSets\nService\nIngress\nStatefulSet\nDaemonSet\nIngress Controller\nConfigMap\nSecret\n\nInsure kubectl is installed. A complete set of installation instruction are available here.\n3.1. Kubernetes Dashboard:\n\nKubernetes Dashboard roles, services & deployment.\nInstall for Dashboard using Helm (not needed if MicroK8s is installed): kubernetes-dashboard\nIMPORTANT: Always verify the current kubernetes-dashboard yaml file is still correct as used in the below command.\nkubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v1.10.1/src/deploy/recommended/kubernetes-dashboard.yaml\n\nIf you have installed MicroK8s, enable the MicroK8s dashboard;\nmicrok8s.enable dashboard\n\nRemember to prefix all kubectl commands with microk8s if you opted not to create an alias.\n\nVerify Kubernetes Dashboard. Windows replace grep with findstr;\nkubectl get pod --namespace=kube-system |grep dashboard\n\n\nStart proxy for local UI in new terminal;\nkubectl proxy ui\n\n\nOpen URI in default browser:\nhttp://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/\nSelect Token. Generate a token to use there by: Windows replace grep with findstr\nkubectl -n kube-system get secrets | grep dashboard-token\n\nThe token to use is shown on the last line of the output of that command;\nkubectl -n kube-system describe secrets/kubernetes-dashboard-token-btbwf\n\nThe {kubernetes-dashboard-token-btbwf} is retrieved from the output in the previous step. For more information on generating the token, follow the Authentication link in the window.\n\n\n\n4. Helm\nPlease review Mojaloop Helm Chart to understand the relationships between the deployed Mojaloop helm charts.\n4.1. Helm configuration\n\nConfig Helm CLI and install Helm Tiller on K8s cluster:\nhelm init\n\n\nValidate Helm Tiller is up and running. Windows replace grep with findstr:\nkubectl -n kube-system get po | grep tiller\n\n\nAdd mojaloop repo to your Helm config (optional). Linux use with sudo:\nhelm repo add mojaloop http://mojaloop.io/helm/repo/\n\nIf the repo already exists, substitute 'add' with 'apply' in the above command.\n\nAdd the additional dependency Helm repositories. This is needed to resolve Helm Chart dependencies required by Mojaloop charts. Linux use with sudo;\nhelm repo add incubator http://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-charts-incubator\nhelm repo add kiwigrid https://kiwigrid.github.io\n\n\nUpdate helm repositories. Linux use with sudo:\nhelm repo update\n\n\nInstall nginx-ingress for load balancing & external access. Linux use with sudo:\nhelm --namespace kube-public install stable/nginx-ingress\n\n\n\n5. Mojaloop\n5.1. Mojaloop Helm Deployment\n\nInstall Mojaloop. Linux use with sudo:\nDefault installation:\nhelm --namespace demo --name moja install mojaloop/mojaloop\n\nVersion specific installation:\nhelm --namespace demo --name moja install mojaloop/mojaloop -version {version}\n\nList of available versions:\nhelm search -l mojaloop/mojaloop\n\nCustom configured installation:\nhelm --namespace demo --name moja install mojaloop/mojaloop -f {custom-values.yaml}\n\nNote: Download and customize the values.yaml. Also ensure that you are using the value.yaml from the correct version which can be found via Helm Releases.\n\n\n5.2. Verifying Mojaloop Deployment\n\nUpdate your /ect/hosts for local deployment:\nNote: This is only applicable for local deployments, and is not needed if custom DNS or ingress rules are configured in a customized values.yaml.\nvi /etc/hosts\n\nWindows the file can be updated in notepad - need to open with Administrative privileges. File location C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts.\nInclude the following line to the config.\nThe below config is applicable to Helm release >= versions 6.2.2;\n127.0.0.1       central-ledger forensic-logging-sidecar central-kms.local central-settlement.local central-event-processor.local ml-api-adapter.local email-notifier.local account-lookup-service.local quoting-service.local moja-simulator.local\n\nFor Helm releases prior to versions 6.2.2, please include the following in the above configuration;\ninterop-switch.local central-end-user-registry.local central-directory.local central-hub.local\n\n\nTest system health in your browser after installation. This will only work if you have an active helm chart deployment running.\nNote: The examples below are only applicable to a local deployment. The entries should match the DNS values or ingress rules as configured in the values.yaml or otherwise matching any custom ingress rules configured.\nml-api-adapter health test:\nhttp://ml-api-adapter.local/health\ncentral-ledger health test:\nhttp://central-ledger.local/health\n\n\n6. Postman\nPostman is used to send requests and receive responses.\n6.1. Installing Postman\nPlease, follow these instructions: Get Postman and install the Postman application.\n6.2. Setup Postman\nGrab the latest collections & environment files from Mojaloop Postman Github repo: https://github.com/mojaloop/postman\nAfter an initial setup or new deployment, the OSS New Deployment FSP Setup section needs to be completed.

Environment recommendations\nThis environment setup was validated on:\n\n64-bit version of Ubuntu Bionic 18.04(LTS).\nThis guide is based on Ubuntu 18.04.2 (bionic) on a x86_64 desktop with 8 CPU's and 16GB RAM.\n\n2. Kubernetes\nKubernetes installation for a local environment.\n2.1. MicroK8S\nWe recommend install directly from the snap store.\nDon't have the snap command? Install snapd first.\n\nInstalling MicroK8s from snap.\nsnap install microk8s --classic\n\n\nVerify MicroK8s is installed and available.\nmicrok8s.status\n\n\nDuring installation you can use the --wait-ready flag to wait for the kubernetes services to initialise.\nmicrok8s.status --wait -ready\n\n\nTo avoid colliding with a kubectl already installed and to avoid overwriting any existing Kubernetes configuration file, MicroK8s adds a microk8s.kubectl command, configured to exclusively access the new MicroK8s install.\nmicrok8s.kubectl get services\n\n\nThis step is only necessary if you require microk8s.kubectl to function as a standard kubectl command. This DOES NOT mean that you can then use kubectl to access OTHER k8s clusters.\nAn example of why you would use this: You have a bash script or 3rd party tool that expects kubectl to be available. E.g. If you want to use Helm, it will not work against microk8s.kubectl, thus one MUST setup the alias for Helm to function correctly.\nsnap alias microk8s.kubectl kubectl\n\nReverting it at any time;\nsnap unalias kubectl\n\nWe will stick with the standard command of prefixing with microk8s. for this guide.\n\nIf you already have kubectl installed and would like to use it to access the MicroK8s deployment.\nmicrok8s.kubectl config view --raw > $HOME/.kube/config\n\n\nView the current context.\nmicrok8s.kubectl config get-contexts\n\n\nMake sure the current context is microk8s. If not, set it as the current context.\nmicrok8s.kubectl config use-context microk8s\n\n\n\n1.2. Docker\nDocker is deployed as part of the MicroK8s installation. The docker daemon used by MicroK8s is listening on unix:///var/snap/microk8s/current/docker.sock. You can access it with the microk8s.docker command.\n\nIf you require microk8s.docker to function as a standard docker command, you set an alias.\nsudo snap alias microk8s.docker docker\n\nUndo the alias;\nsudo snap unalias docker\n\n\nWe will apply the native microK8s commands by prefix commands microk8s.\nmicrok8s.docker ps\n\n\nContinue setup and configuration from the Kubernetes Dashboard section in the Mojaloop's deployment guide document.\n\n\n2. Useful Tips\n\nResolve problems with VSCode and kafka on ubuntu 18.04. To make the code work with VSCode debugger, added the following into the launch.json \"env\": {\n         \"LD_LIBRARY_PATH\": \"${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/node-rdkafka/build/deps\",\n         \"WITH_SASL\": 0\n       }\n\n\n\n"},"deployment-guide/local-setup-mac.html":{"url":"deployment-guide/local-setup-mac.html","title":"Local Setup Mac","keywords":"","body":"Mojaloop local environment setup for Mac\nLocal setup on a Laptop or Desktop to run the Mojaloop project.\nSetup Introduction\nThis document will provide guidelines to a technical capable resources to setup, deploy and configure the Mojaloop applications on a local environment, utilizing Docker, Kubernetes and HELM charts.\nAt this point the reader/implementer should be familiar with Mojaloop's deployment guide.

Hyper-V will be enable as part of the installation process,\nWindows 10 64bit: Pro, Enterprise, Education (1607 Anneversary Update, Build 14393 or later),\nCPU SLAT-capable feature,\nAt least 4GB of RAM. (At least 16GB will be required to run the Mojaloop project).\n\n\nInstalling Docker for Windows:\nYou will require Docker Desktop for Windows 18.02 Edge (win50) and higher, or 18.06 Stable (win 70) and higher. Kubernetes on Docker Desktop for Windows is available on these versions and higher. They are downloadable from:\nhttps://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/\nOnce download is completed, the downloaded file can normally be found in your Download folder. Installation is as per normal installations for windows. A restart will be required after this step.\n\nEnable visualization:  \nDocker Desktop for Windows requires Microsoft Hyper-V to run. The Docker Desktop installer enables Hyper-V for you.\nIf Hyper-V is not enabled, A pop-up messages will request if you would like to turn this on. Read the messages and select 'Ok' if appropriate.\nYou need to insure that VT-X/AMD-v is enabled from cmd.exe:\nsysteminfo\n\nIf not, from cmd.exe run as Administrator and execute:\nbcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype auto\n\nA reboot would be required again for the updates to take effect.\n\nStart Docker Desktop for Windows:\nDocker does not start automatically after installation. To start it, select Docker Desktop and click on it (or hit Enter).\nWhen the whale in the status bar stays steady, Docker Desktop is up-and-running, and accessible from any terminal window. Note - if the whale is not on the status bar, it will be in the hidden icon notifications area, click the up arrow on the taskbar to show it.\n  \n\n\n1.2 Kubernetes environment setup\n\nSetting up the Kubernetes runtime environment within Docker Desktop:\n\nOpen the Docker Desktop for Windows menu by right-clicking the Docker icon. \n\nSelect Settings to open the settings dialog. \nUnder the General tab you can configure when to start and update Docker. \n\n\nGo to Advanced tab\n\nIncrease the CPU allocation to at least 4\nIncrease the Memory allocation to at least 8.0 GiB\n\n\n\n(If your system resource allow, more can be allocated as indicated below.)\n  \nKubernetes on Docker Desktop for Windows is available in 18.02 Edge (win50) and higher, and in 18.06 Stable (win 70) and higher.\n\ngo to Kubernetes tab\nSelect Enable Kubernetes\nSelect Show system container (advanced)\n\n\n\n  \n\nSet the context to be used.\nAs mentioned, the Kubernetes client command, kubectl is included and configured to connect to the local Kubernetes server.

In addition, anything that is in the backlog and not assigned to someone are things we could use help with. Stories that have owners are in someone's backlog already, though you can always ask about them in the issue or on Slack.\nThere's a roadmap that shows larger work that people could do or are working on.

We provide code to link together new and existing financial providers using a common scheme. There are central services for identifying a customer's provider, quoting, fulfillment, deferred net settlement, and shared fraud management. Each provider can take advantage of these services to send and receive money with others on the system and there's no cost to them to onboard new providers. We provide code for a simple example mobile money provider to show how integration can be done, but our example DFSP is not meant to be a production mobile money provider.\nWhere do I send bugs, questions, and feedback?\nFor bugs, see Reporting bugs.\nRelated Projects\nThe Interledger Protocol Suite (ILP) is an open and secure standard that enables DFSPs to settle payments with minimal counter-party risk (the risk you incur when someone else is holding your money). With ILP, you can transact across different systems with no chance that someone in the middle disappears with your money.

We also have included the recommendation links/versions for each of these tools.\nTOOL CHOICES\n\nAPI Development\nRAML and Swagger 2.0 is leveraged for API development.\nWSO2 offers an enterprise platform for integrating APIs, applications, and web services—locally and across the Internet. It also provides Mojaloop with a Security Layer, and Development Portal.\n\n\nCircle-CI - This tool is used for continuous build and continuous deployment. We needed an online continuous build and testing system that can work with many small projects and a distributed team. Jenkins was considered, but it requires hosting a server and a lot of configuration. CircleCI allowed for a no host solution that could be started with no cost and very limited configuration. We thought we might start with CircleCI and move off later if we outgrew it, but that hasn’t been needed.\nDactyl – We need to be able to print the online documentation. While it’s possible to print markdown files directly one at a time, we’d like to put the files into set of final PDF documents, where one page might end up in more than one final manual. Dactyl is a maintained open source conversion tool that converts between markdown and PDF. We originally tried Pandoc, but it had bugs with converting tables. Dactyl fixes that and is much more flexible.\nDBeaver - DBeaver is a free multi-platform database tool for developers, SQL programmers, database administrators and analysts. Supports all popular databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, SQLite, Oracle, DB2, SQL Server, Sybase, MS Access, Teradata, Firebird, Derby, etc.\nDocker - The Docker container engine creates and runs the Docker container from the Docker image file.\nDocker hub is used to link, build, test and push the Mojaloop code repositories. We needed to support both local and cloud execution. We have many small microservices that have very simple specific configurations and requirements. The easiest way to guarantee that the service works the same way in every environment from local development, to cloud, to hosted production is to put each microservice in a Docker container along with all the prerequisites it needs to run. The container becomes a secure, closed, pre-configured, runnable unit.\nDraw.io – We need to create pictures for our documents and architecture diagrams using an (ideally free) open source friendly tool, that is platform agnostic, supports vector and raster formats, allows WYSIWYG drawing, works with markdown, and is easy to use. We looked at many tools including: Visio, Mermaid, PlantUML, Sketchboard.io, LucidChart, Cacoo, Archi, and Google Drawings. Draw.io scored at the top for our needs. It’s free, maintained, easy to use, produces our formats, integrates with DropBox and GitHub, and platform agnostic. In order to save our diagrams, we have to save two copies – one in SVG (scalable vector) format and the other in PNG (raster). We use the PNG format within the docs since it can be viewed directly in GitHub. The SVG is used as the master copy as it is editable.\nESLint - Within JavaScript code, we use ESLint as a code style guide and style enforcement tool.\nGitHub – GitHub is a widely-used source code repository service, based on git, the standard source code version control system for open source projects. So the decision to use GitHub was straightforward. We create a story every time for integration work. Create bugs for any issues. Ensure all stories are tracked throughout the pipeline to ensure reliable metrics.\nHelm - The Helm package manager for Kubernetes provides templatized deployments and configurations and allow for overall complexity management.\nKafka - This technology is leveraged to support Mojaloop’s demand for a high velocity and high volume data messaging but keep our hardware requirements minimum.\nJavaScript - The Mojaloop application is primarily written in JavaScript.\nKubectl - This is a command line interface for running commands against Kubernetes clusters.\nKubernetes - This enterprise tool provides an extraction layer, infrastructure management and a container-orchestration system.\nMarkdown – Documentation is a deliverable for this project, just like the code, and so we want to treat it like the code in terms of versioning, review, check in, and tracking changes. We also want the documentation to be easily viewable online without constantly opening a viewer. GitHub has a built-in format called Markdown which solves this well. The same files work for the Wiki and the documents. They can be reviewed with the check in using the same tools and viewed directly in GitHub. We considered Google Docs, Word and PDF, but these binary formats aren’t easily diff-able. A disadvantage is that markdown only allows simple formatting – no complex tables or font changes - but this should be fine when our main purpose is clarity.\nMySQLWorkbench – MySQL Workbench is a unified visual tool for database architects, developers, and DBAs. MySQL Workbench provides data modeling, SQL development, and comprehensive administration tools for server configuration, user administration, backup, and much more. MySQL Workbench is available on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.\nNodeJS - This development tool is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that runs Mojaloop. NodeJS is designed to create simple microservices and it has a huge set of open source libraries available. Node performance is fine and while Node components don’t scale vertically a great deal, but we plan to scale horizontally, which it does fine. The original Interledger code was written in NodeJS as was the level one prototype. Most teams used Node already, so this made sense as a language. Within NodeJS code, we use Standard as a code style guide and to enforce code style.\nNPM - NPM is the package manager for Mojaloop since JavaScript is the default programming language.\nPercona for MySQL - These tools are leveraged as a relational database management system to ensure high performance and enterprise-grade functionality for the Mojaloop system. We needed a SQL backend that is open source friendly and can scale in a production environment. Thus, we chose MySQL, an open-source relational database management system.\nPostman is a Google Chrome application for interacting with HTTP APIs. It presents you with a friendly GUI for constructing requests and reading responses.\nRancher 2.0 - The Infrastructure management, provisioning and monitoring is provided by Rancher 2.0 which is an enterprise Kubernetes platform that manage Kubernetes deployments, clusters, on cloud & on-prem. Rancher makes it easy for DevOps teams to test, deploy and manage the Mojaloop system no matter where it is running.\nSlack – Slack is used for internal team communication. This was largely picked because several team already used it and liked it as a lightweight approach compared to email.\nSonarQube – We need an online dashboard of code quality (size, complexity, issues, and coverage) that can aggregate the code from all the repos. We looked at several online services (CodeCov, Coveralls, and Code Climate), but most couldn’t do complexity or even number of lines of code. Code Climate has limited complexity (through ESLint), but costs 6.67/seat/month. SonarQube is free, though it required us to setup and maintain our own server. It gave the P1 features we wanted.\nSourceTree – Sourcetree simplifies how you interact with your Git repositories so you can focus on coding. Visualize and manage your repositories through Sourcetree's simple Git GUI.\nStories On Board - We use Stories on Board to help capture our high level Epics at a portfolio level before they are commmitted and moved to Github. Our Story Board for Mojaloop is located here\nVisual Studio Code - Visual Studio Code is a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications. Visual Studio Code is free and available on your favorite platform - Linux, macOS, and Windows.\nZenHub – We needed a project management solution that was very light weight and cloud based to support distributed teams. It had to support epics, stories, and bugs and a basic project board. VS and Jira online offerings were both considered. For a small distributed development team an online service was better. For an open source project, we didn’t want ongoing maintenance costs of a server. Direct and strong GitHub integration was important. It was very useful to track work for each microservice with that microservice. Jira and VS both have more overhead than necessary for a project this size and don’t integrate as cleanly with GitHub as we’d want. ZenHub allowed us to start work immediately. A disadvantage is the lack of support for cumulative flow diagrams and support for tracking # of stories instead of points, so we do these manually with a spreadsheet updated daily and the results published to the \"Project Management\" Slack channel.\n\nTECHNOLOGY CHOICES\n\nAgile development - This methodology is used to track and run the project. The requirements need to be refined as the project is developed, therefore we picked agile development over waterfall or lean.\nAPIs - In order to avoid confusion from too many changing microservices, we use strongly defined APIs that conform to our Pragmatic REST design pattern. APIs will be defined using OpenAPI or RAML. Teams document their APIs with Swagger v2.0 or RAML v0.8 so they can automatically test, document, and share their work. Swagger is slightly preferred as there are free tools. Mule will make use of RAML 0.8. Swagger can be automatically converted to RAML v0.8, or manually to RAML v1.0 if additional readability is desired.\nAutomated Testing - For the most part, most testing will be automated to allow for easy regression. See the automated testing strategy and code quality metrics for standards.\nHosting - Mojaloop has been designed to be infrastructure agnostic and as such is supported by AWS, Azure and On-Premise installations.\nInterledger – Mojaloop needed a lightweight, open, and secure transport protocol for funds. Interledger.org provides all that. It also provides the ability to connect to other systems. We also considered block chain systems, but block chain systems send very large messages which will be harder to guarantee delivery of in third world infrastructure. Also, while blockchain systems provide good anonymity, that is not a project goal. To enable fraud detection, regulatory authorities need to be able to request records of transfers by account and person.\nOpen source - The entire project has been released as open source in accordance with the Level One Project principles. All tools and processes must be open source friendly and support projects that use an Apache 2.0 license with no restrictive licenses requirements on developers.\nOperating System – Microsoft Windows is widely used in many target countries, but we need an operating system that is free of license fees and is open source compatible. We are using Linux. We don’t have a dependency on the particular flavor, but are using the basic Amazon Linux. In the Docker containers, Alpine Linux is used.\nMicroservices - Because the architecture needs to easily deploy, scale, and have components be easily replaced or upgraded, it will be built as a set of microservices.\nScaled Agile Framework - There were four initial development teams that are geographically separate. To keep the initial phase of the project on track, the scaled agile framework (SAFe) was picked. This means work is divided into program increments (PI) that are typically four 2 week sprints long. As with the sprints, the PI has demo-able objective goals defined in each PI meeting.\nServices - Microservices are grouped and deployed in a few services such as the DFSP, Central Directory, etc. Each of these will have simple defined interfaces, configuration scripts, tests, and documentation.\nThreat Modeling, Resilience Modeling, and Health Modeling - Since the Mojaloop code needs to exchange money in an environment with very flaky infrastructure it must have good security, resilience, and easily report it's health state and automatically attempt to return to it. \nUSSD - Smart phones are only 25% of the target market and not currently supported by most money transfer service, so we need a protocol that will work on simple feature phones. Like M-Pesa, we are using USSD between the phone and the digital financial service provider (DFSP).\n\n"},"contributors-guide/tools-and-technologies/pragmatic-rest.html":{"url":"contributors-guide/tools-and-technologies/pragmatic-rest.html","title":"Pragmatic REST","keywords":"","body":"Pragmatic REST\nPragmatic REST For the Mojaloop Project\nWith the emergence of API strategy as a scaling tool for Internet service businesses, the focus on interconnect technology has shifted. Building on the principles that enabled the Web to form and scale, REST (Representational State Transfer) has become a design preference for Internet service APIs. But while the REST principles, proposed in Roy Fielding's dissertation that defined them, have academic value as a basis for research, a pure REST design is not at present practical for most applications. We are advocating a kind of Pragmatic REST-a design pattern that adopts the beneficial components of RESTful design without requiring strict adherence to academic purity.\nThe Richardson Maturity Model\nMartin Fowler has referenced1 a structured model of RESTful adoption developed by Leonard Richardson and explained at a QCon talk. Fowler refers to this as the Richardson Maturity Model of RESTful design.\n\nMartin Fowler, referencing Rest in Practice,2 summarizes the genesis of RESTful design:\n\nuse Restful web services to handle many of the integration problems that enterprises face. At its heart . . . is the notion that the web is an existence proof of a massively scalable distributed system that works really well, and we can take ideas from that to build integrated systems more easily.\n\nA pragmatic approach to RESTful design uses the best parts of Fielding's conceptual framework to allow developers and integrators to understand what they can do with the API as rapidly as possible and without writing extraneous code.\nAt its most fundamental, a RESTful design is resource-centric and uses HTTP verbs. At its most advanced, a design that follows pure academic REST utilizes the HATEOAS principle by implementing Hypermedia Controls. We are advocating a Level 2 RESTful design for Mojaloop.\nWhy not Hypermedia Controls?\nAlthough HATEOAS is a fascinating principle-it advocates that a server should respond to each client action with a list of all possible actions that can lead the client to its next application state. And further, clients must not rely on out of band information (like a written API spec) for what actions can be performed on which resources or on the format of URIs.\nIt is this final proscription that fails the test of Pragmatic REST: While HATEOAS is an interesting theoretical approach to limit coupling, it does not easily apply to Mojaloop (or any other contract API design). When we take into account our audience for the interconnect APIs, we find a group of commercial entities that will be operating under a set of highly specific scheme rules. Interactions between the participants, and between participant and central service hub, will be highly specified to assign acceptable commercial risk that can be priced at very low cost to end-users. This requires ex-ante predictability of the API which is anathema to the HATEOAS principle defined by Fielding.\nPragmatic RESTful Principles\nURIs Define Resources\nA well-designed URI pattern makes an API easy to consume, discover, and extend, just as a carefully designed API does in a traditional programming language. Pure REST disdains this principle in favor of HATEOAS. But pragmatic REST follows a normal pattern for URI definitions to improve human understanding, even if HATEOAS principles are employed for discovery.\nURI paths that refer to a collection of objects should consist of a plural noun, e.g. /customers, to refer to a set of customers. When a collection can have only one instance, the singular noun should be used to avoid confusion. E.g. GET /transfers/:id/fulfillment is correct, since there is only one fulfillment object per identified transfer.\nURI paths that refer to a single object should consist of a plural noun (representing the collection), followed by a predefined unique identifier. E.g., /customers/123456 to refer to the specific customer with number 123456. The identifier must be unique within the containing collection and persist for the life of the object within that collection. IDs must not be ordinal values-ordinal retrieval of objects from a collection is possible using query parameters on the collection URI.\nURI paths may have a prefix to identify the environment, version, or other context of the resource. Nothing should follow the identifying path but collections and object references.\nURI path and query segment identifiers should be chosen from the Roman character set, [0-9A-Za-z]. Use camelCase to define the elements of the URI path. Do not use snake_case.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, \"_\" (underscore) and \"-\" (hyphen) should not be used in URI path or query segment identifiers.\nThis probably seems a bit parochial. The purpose is to find a well-defined URI format that is consistent with wide-spread practice, easy to define, predictable, and that maps to native environments and conventions. It isn't going to satisfy everyone. Here is reasoning behind this constraint:\nCapitalCase and camelCase are the defacto standard for NodeJS and JavaScript and are a common constraint in URI definition: URI path segments are often mapped to JS internal resources and so conforming to JS naming conventions makes sense.\nField names in JSON and SQL should also follow this convention since they are often automatically mapped into variable name space and can be referenced in URIs as path or query segment identifiers.\nWe should also avoid the use of \"$\" unless it is required by a library (e.g. JQuery). IBM JCL has passed away; let it rest in peace. There are better scope control tools to separate name spaces than introducing non-roman symbols.\nWe should avoid \"-\" (hyphen) in path segment and query parameter names as it does not map into variable names, SQL, or JSON field name identifiers.\nUnderscore characters must be escaped in markdown source by prefixing each with a \"\\\" character.\nSnake_case has been reported to be slightly easier to read than camelCase in variable names, but it actually does not improve readability of URIs, as it visually interferes with path and query segment delimiters making it difficult to visually parse them. And when URIs are underlined in presentation, the underscores become illegible.\nURI Parameters\nUse a standard and predictable set of optional parameters in a consistent way.\nA set of standard query parameters should be used for collections to enable caller control over how much of the collection they see. E.g. \"count\" to determine how many objects to return, \"start\" to determine where to start counting in the result set, and \"q\" as a generic free-form search query. We will define the standard set of parameters as we go and will apply them consistently.\nVerbs\nSingular objects should support GET for read, PUT for complete replacement (or creation when the primary key is specified by the client and is persistent, e.g. a payment card PAN), and DELETE for delete.\nCollections should support GET to read back the whole or part of a collection, and POST to add a new object to the collection.\nSingular objects may support POST as a way to change their state in specified ways. Posting a JSON document to a singular object URI may allow selected field values to be updated or trigger a state change or action without replacing the whole object.\nGET must be implemented in a nullipotent manner-that is, GET never causes side effects and never modifies client-visible system state (other than logging events or updating instrumentation, e.g.).\nPUT and DELETE must be implemented in an idempotent manner-that is, changes are applied consistently to the system data in a way that is dependent only on the state of the resource and inputs but on nothing else. The action has no additional effect if it is executed more than once with the same input parameters and does not depend on the order of other operations on a containing collection or other resources held in the collection. For example, removing a resource from a collection can be considered an idempotent operation on the collection. Using PUT to fully replace (or create) a uniquely identified resource when the URI is fully known to the client is also idempotent. This implies that the system may reorder operations to improve efficiency, and the client does not need to know whether a resource exists before attempting to replace it.\nPOST and PATCH3 are not idempotent operations. POST is used to create new resources where the resource identifier is assigned by the server or where a single identified internal resource is implied by the target URI (e.g. POST /transfers, but PUT /transfers/:id/fulfillment).\nData Format\nWe favor JSON4 related data formats over XML. In some cases, data formats will be binary or XML, as defined by pre-existing standards, and these will be precisely specified. Binary formats should have a formal syntax to avoid ambiguous representational translations (e.g. character set translations, big- or little-endian representations of numeric values, etc).\nDate and time values used in APIs should comply to the ISO 8601 standard, and further profiled by the w3c Note on Date and Time Formats.5 This w3c note should lead to the reduction in complexity and error scope of communicating components that must exchange tangible dates and times. There will be cases where we use non-ISO format date or time as required by an external standard, e.g. ISO 7813 expiry dates.\nExisting standard XML formats should have an XSD schema for the acceptable subset profile used within the project. For particularly complex data formats, we may use a common format profile translator to map between our project subset of the standard format and the wire format used by a standardized protocol (e.g.). This will limit coupling to complex formats in a more maintainable way.\nWhen specifying the PATCH action for a resource, we will use a consistent patch document format (e.g. JSON Patch6).\nReturn Codes\nUse HTTP return codes in a consistent way and according to their standard definitions. The standard codes are defined in RFC 2616.7\nMachine Readable Error Format\nThe API should provide a machine readable error result in a well-defined JSON format. {TBD whether to use a response envelope and how to format errors, faults, and success envelopes. RESTful design relies on headers to carry protocol-defined errors, debug info can also be carried in headers. We should be clear on why we are using an envelope and how this supports normal production communication between client and server.\nVersioning\nAPI URIs should include a version identifier in the format vM as a leading path element (where \"M\" is the Major component of the multi-part version number). The API and its version identifier element must conform to the semantic versioning8 2.0 specification for API versioning.\nA client must specify the Major version number in each request. It is not possible for a client to express a requirement for a specific minor version.\nThe full API version number is specified in the response header (TBD) for all successful and error responses.\nWhile an API version contract will be influenced by Major, minor, and patch levels, only the Major version number is a production API binding element-that is, a production client cannot request a particular minor version or patch level and a production server will not accept a URI request that specifies these extra elements.\nHowever, in pre-production environments, it is anticipated that some combination of minor, patch, pre-release, and metadata suffixes would be supported in client requests (as defined in semver [3]) and may be expressed in pre-production URIs to assist with development and integration scenarios.\nWe May Need to Give REST a Rest\nAs we design the interconnection APIs between components and between participating systems, we may find API requirements that don't precisely match the Pragmatic REST pattern defined here. We will evaluate these case-by-case and make the best choice to support the project goals.\nNon-Functional Requirements\nAs we develop the APIs, we will make consistent choices about non-functional requirements to reinforce the project goals.\n1: http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html, retrieved August 18, 2016.\n2: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596805829, retrieved August 18, 2016.\n3: RFC 5789, PATCH Method for HTTP, https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789, retrieved August 18, 2016.\n4: Introducing JSON, http://json.org/, retrieved August 18, 2016.\n5: http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/NOTE-datetime-19980827, retrieved August 22, 2016.\n6: JSON Patch, http://jsonpatch.com/, retrieved August 18, 2016.\n7: https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html\n8: Semantic Versioning 2.0.0, http://semver.org/, retrieved August 18, 2016.\n"},"contributors-guide/tools-and-technologies/code-quality-metrics.html":{"url":"contributors-guide/tools-and-technologies/code-quality-metrics.html","title":"Code Quality Metrics","keywords":"","body":"Code Quality Metrics\nFunctional quality metrics\nUnit test metrics\nHigh coverage and low dependencies show that the code is testable and therefore well isolated and easy to maintain.

Also, the tests are automatically executed every time a check-in is done and a Github Pull-Request issued for the code to be integrated into the project.\nThe procedure described above, falls outside the realm of Quality Assurance (QA) and Regression testing, which this document addresses.\nOnce a developer has written new functionality or extended existing functionality, by having to go through the above rigorous tests, one can assume the functionality in question is executing as intended. How does one then ensure that this new portion of code does not negatively affect the project or product as a whole?\nWhen the code has passed all of the above and is deployed as part of the CI/CD processes implemented by our workflow, the new component(s) are accepted onto the various hosts, cloud-based or on-premise implementations. These hosts ranges from development platforms through to production environments.\n\n\nPostman and Newman Testing\n Parallel to the deployment process is the upkeep and maintenance of the Postman Collection testing Framework. When a new release is done, as part of the workflow, Release Notes are published listing all of the new and/or enhanced functionality implemented as part of the release. These notes are used by the QA team to extend and enhance the existing Postman Collections where tests are written behind the request/response scripts to test both positive as well as negative scenarios agains the intended behaviour. These tests are then run in the following manner:\n\nManually to determine if the tests cover all aspects and angles of the functionality, positive to assert intended behaviour and negative tests to determine if the correct alternate flows work as intended when something unexpected goes wrong\nScheduled - as part of the Regression regime, to do exactly the same as the manual intent, but fully automated (with the Newman Package) with reports and logs produced to highlight any unintended behaviour and to also warn where known behaviour changed from a previous run.\n\nIn order to facilitate the automated and scheduled testing of a Postman Collection, there are various methods one can follow and the one implemented for Mojaloop use is explained further down in this document.\nThere is a complete repository containing all of the scripts, setup procedures and anything required in order to set up an automated QA and Regression Testing Framework. This framework allows one to target any Postman Collection, specifying your intended Environment to execute against, as well as a comma-separated list of intended email recipients to receive the generated report. This framework is in daily use by Mojaloop and exists on an EC2 instance on AWS, hosting the required components like Node, Docker, Email Server and Newman, as well as various Bash Scripts and Templates for use by the framework to automatically run the intended collections every day. Using this guide will allow anyone to set up their own Framework.\nPostman Collections\nThere are a number of Postman collections in use throughout the different processes:\n\nOSS-New-Deployment-FSP-Setup : This collection needs to be executed once after a new deployment, normally by the Release Manager, to seed the Database with the required enumerations and static data, as well as test FSPs with their accounts and position data in order to be able to execute any manual or automation tests by other collections.\nNotes: Ensure that there is a delay of 200ms if executed through Postman UI Test Runner. This will ensure that tests have enough time to validate requests against the simulator. \n\n\nOSS-API-Tests : This suite of tests will issue a request/response against each and every exposed API, testing APIs such as the Mojaloop core APIs, bulk quotes, admin-APIs, Settlement APIs, Metrics APIs, Fund-in and out APIs etc. These tests are done to test the message headers, body, responses received and not to test the end-to-end flow of a transfer for example\nNotes: Ensure that there is a delay of 1500ms if executed through Postman UI Test Runner. This will ensure that tests have enough time to validate requests against the simulator.\n\n\nOSS-Feature-Tests : Scenario based testing are performed with this collection, such as Settlements processes, Block Transfers, Negative testing scenarios and so on\nNotes: Ensure that there is a delay of 1500ms if executed through Postman UI Test Runner. This will ensure that tests have enough time to validate requests against the simulator.\n\n\nGolden_Path : This test collection is the one used by the scheduled regression testing framework to test end-to-end scenarios, resembling real-world use-cases where the response from one API call is used to populate the request of a subsequent call. We make use of an intelligent simulator playing the role of an FSP on the recipient side of the scenario, responding to various request from a Payer FSP as an example\nNotes: Ensure that there is a delay of 1500ms if executed through Postman UI Test Runner. This will ensure that tests have enough time to validate requests against the simulator.\n\n\n\nEnvironment Configuration\nYou will need to customize the following environment config file to match your deployment environment:\n\nLocal Environment Config\n\nTips: \n\nThe host configurations will be the most likely changes required to match your environment. e.g. HOST_CENTRAL_LEDGER: http://central-ledger.local\nRefer to the ingress hosts that have been configured in your values.yaml as part of your Helm deployment.\n\nExecuting regression test\nFor the Mojaloop QA and Regression Testing Framework specifically, Postman regression test can be executed by going into the EC2 instance via SSH, for which you need the PEM file, and then by running a script(s).\nFollowing the requirements and instructions as set out in the detail in QA and Regression Testing Framework, everyone will be able to create their own Framework and gain access to their instance to execute tests against any Postman Collection targeting any Environment they have control over.\nSteps to execute the script via Postman UI\n\nImport the desired collection into your Postman UI. You can either download the collection from the repo or alternatively use the RAW link and import it directly via the import link option.\nImport the environment config into your Postman UI via the Environmental Config setup. Note that you will need to download the environmental config to your machine and customize it to your environment.\nEnsure that you have pre-loaded all prerequisite test data before executing transactions (party, quotes, transfers) as per the example collection OSS-New-Deployment-FSP-Setup:\nHub Accounts\nFSP onboarding\nAdd any test data to Simulator (if applicable)\nOracle onboarding\n\n\nThe p2p_money_transfer test cases from the Golden_Path collection are a good place to start.\n\nSteps to execute the bash script to run the Newman / Postman test via CLI\n\nTo run a test via this method, you will have to be in posession of the PEM-file of the server on which the Mojaloop QA and Regression Framework was deployed on an EC2 instance on Amazon Cloud.\n\nSSH into the specific EC2 instance and when running the script, it will in turn run the commands via an instantiated Docker container.\n\nYou will notice that by using this approach where both the URLs for the Postman-Collection and Environment File are required as input parameters (together with a comma-delimited email recipient list for the report) you have total freedom of executing any Postman Collection you choose.\n\nAlso, by having an Environment File, the specific Mojaloop services targeted can be on any server. This means you can execute any Postman test against any Mojaloop installation on any server of your choice.\n\nThe EC2 instance we execute these tests from are merely containing all the tools and processes in order to execute your required test and does not host any Mojaloop Services as such.\n\n\n./testMojaloop.sh   \nProcess flow of a typical Scheduled Test\n\nNewman Commands\nThe following section is a reference, obtained from the Newman Package site itself, highlighting the different commands that may be used in order to have access to the Postman environment by specifying some commands via the CLI.\nExample:\n+ newman run  -e  -n 1 --\n\nUsage: run  [options]\n\n  URL or path to a Postman Collection.\n\n    Options:\n\n    -e, --environment         Specify a URL or Path to a Postman Environment.\n    -g, --globals             Specify a URL or Path to a file containing Postman Globals.\n    --folder                  Specify folder to run from a collection.

The following are foundation-specific guidelines which have been updated and slightly modified.\nAcronyms\nSpell out all acronyms on first reference. Include the acronym in parentheses immediately after the full spelling only if you refer to it again in the document. Example: Kofi Annan, chairman of the board of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), traveled to Nairobi this month. It was his first visit to the AGRA office.\nAmpersand\nOnly use an ampersand (&) when it's part of a formal name like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In all other cases, spell out and.\nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation\nOur formal legal name is the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Use it on first reference. Always use the ampersand (&) and always capitalize Foundation when Bill & Melinda Gates comes before it.\nNever abbreviate the foundation's name as BMGF.\nNever translate the foundation name into other languages, as it is a proper noun. The one exception to this is when translating the foundation's name into Chinese, in which case translation is acceptable.\nDo not capitalize foundation when the word stands alone. Example: The foundation's new headquarters will be built near Seattle Center.\nUse Gates Foundation only if you are sure the context makes the foundation's identity clear. There is a Gates Family Foundation in Colorado, so we need to be careful. Example: The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Ford Foundation co-sponsored the event. A Gates Foundation staff member gave closing remarks.\nThe entity that manages the endowment is formally and legally known as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust. You will not need to refer to this entity often, but when you do, write it out on first reference and refer to it as the asset trust thereafter.\nBold and colons\nFrequently I see structures (like in this very comment!) where you have introductory terms or phrases that are bolded and set apart from the contents with a colon. Should the colon also be bolded, or not? (I frequently see it done both ways.)\nBuffett\nNote the spelling: two fs and two ts (i.e., Warren Buffett).\nBulleted lists\nIntroduce bulleted lists with a colon when the listed items complete the lead-in sentence or phrase. Exception: never use colons in headings or subheadings to introduce bulleted lists.\nCapitalize the first words of and use periods with listed items only if they are full sentences. Examples:\n\nThis is a complete sentence.\nnot a complete sentence\n\nNever link items in a bulleted list with coordinating conjunctions and punctuation (semicolons or commas) as you would in a sentence-style list. In other words, never do:\n\nthis,\nthat, or\nthe other thing.\n\nCaptions\nCaption photos whenever possible. It helps people understand our work.\nWrite captions as single gerund (ing verb) phrases, followed by the city, state or country, and year the photo was taken in parentheses. Example: A doctor preparing a vaccine for delivery (Brazzaville, Congo, 2007)._\nWhen writing a caption, be sure to introduce the people featured and explain what's happening in the image as it relates to our areas of focus. Be as brief as possible so you don't distract from the image or layout. Avoid verbs that state the obvious about what the photo's subject is doing (e.g., smiling, standing, and so on).\nIf one of the co-chairs appears in a photo with other people, be sure to identify the co-chair in the caption. Don't assume everyone knows what our co-chairs look like.\nCitations\nMost fields have their own citation conventions. Adopt those used by the field in question. When citation conventions are unavailable or uncertain, follow The Chicago Manual of Style.\nWhen a document uses both footnotes and endnotes, for the footnotes, use the following symbols:\n\n1st note = * (asterisk)\n2nd note = † (dagger)\n3rd note = ‡ (double dagger)\n4th note = § (section sign)\n5th note = ** (2 asterisks)\n6th note = †† (2 daggers)\n7th note = ‡‡ (2 double daggers)\n8th note = §§ (2 section signs) \n\nSeparate multiple superscript references (footnotes, endnotes) with commas, not semicolons.\nClinical trials\nUse Roman numerals when referring to clinical trial phases and always capitalize Phase. Example: The company will begin Phase III trials on the new drug this spring.\nContact information\nUse periods to separate parts of phone numbers, and begin each number with a plus sign.\nBecause we work with people throughout the world, omit the international access code, which differs from country to country (it's 011 in the United States). Examples: +1.206.709.3100 (United States) +91.11.4100.3100 (India)\nCopyright and trademark notice\nAll publications, media, and materials produced by or for the foundation should contain the notice shown below. The Legal team must approve all exceptions.\n © (year) Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. All Rights Reserved. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is a registered trademark in the United States and other countries.\nWhen possible, begin the trademark portion of the notice on a separate line.\nDashes\nUse dashes—those the width of a capital M—to indicate asides or abrupt changes in thought. Use en dashes—those the width of a capital N—with numerical ranges.\nDo not include a space before or after a dash.\nExamples: We work to make safe, affordable financial services—particularly savings accounts—more widely available to people in developing countries.\nIn the 2004 presidential election, 76 percent of U.S. college graduates ages 25-44 voted.\nDollars ($)\nIn Global Health and Global Development materials, because more than a dozen countries use dollars, specify U.S. dollars in parentheses on first mention in a document. Example: $100,000 (U.S.). Omit the parenthetical U.S. in subsequent references to dollar amounts in the same document.\nFoundation program names\nWe have three programs: Global Development Program, Global Health Program, and United States Program.\nProgram is capitalized when used with the full name (Global Development Program), but not when used alone (The program makes grants in several areas.).\nUse periods when abbreviating the name of the United States Program: U.S. Program.\nGH, GD, and USP are fine for internal use, but inappropriate for external publications.\nGates family\nWilliam Gates III is formally referred to as Bill Gates. In internal documents, use Bill—not a nickname or abbreviation.\nUse Melinda Gates when formally referring to Melinda.\nUse William H. Gates Sr. when formally referring to Bill Gates Sr. There is no comma between Gates and Sr. Bill Sr. is acceptable in internal documents.\nPlural: Gateses. Do not use an apostrophe to form the plural of the family's name. Example: The Gateses attended the opening of the new University of Washington law building.\nPossessive: The apostrophe follows Gates when you refer to something owned by either Bill or Melinda. Example: Melinda Gates' speech was well received. The apostrophe follows Gateses when you refer to something Bill and Melinda own jointly. Example: The Gateses' decision to provide free Internet access in U.S. public libraries has increased library usage and circulation overall.\nYou may also phrase it this way: Bill and Melinda Gates' decision to provide free Internet access …\nSee the Titles of people entry for the formal titles of Bill, Melinda, Bill Sr., and other leaders of the foundation.\nHyphens\nThere are few hard-and-fast rules when it comes to hyphens. Generally we use them to enhance the reader's understanding.\nExamples: When writing for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, use real-world poverty examples to illustrate your point. When writing for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, use real world-poverty examples to illustrate your point.\nIn the first example, the hyphen in real-world connects real and world to form a single adjective describing poverty. In the second example, the hyphen in world-poverty connects world and poverty to form a single adjective describing examples.\nThe meaning changes depending on the placement of the hyphen. In instances where a series of adjectives creates ambiguity about what they refer to, use a hyphen to clarify the intended meaning.\nWhen capitalizing hyphenated words, only capitalize the first part. Example: Co-chairs Bill and Melinda Gates.\nFor other uses of hyphens—compound modifiers, prefixes and suffixes, fractions—refer to the Associated Press Stylebook.\nNumerals\nWhen referring to dollar figures, spell out million and billion. Use figures and decimals (not fractions). Do not go beyond two decimal places. Example: The foundation granted .45 million to United Way.\nWhen using numbers that have nothing to do with dollar figures or percentages, write them out if they are under 10, and use numerals if they are 10 or over. Example: Four program officers went on 13 site visits.\nIn cases of grammatical parallelism, parallel construction always trumps this rule. For instance: Mr. Johnson has two children, 5-year-old Kyle and 13-year-old Frances.\nNever begin a sentence with a numeral. Either spell the number out or revise the sentence so it doesn't begin with a number.\nPercentages\nWhen using percentages, write out percent (don't use %). Use numerals instead of writing numbers out, even if they're less than 10.\nExample: This program accounts for 6 percent of our grantmaking.\nPhotographer credits\nIf the foundation owns the image you are using, you don't need to credit the photographer. All images in our media asset management system are foundation-owned. If the foundation has purchased a license to use the image, you may need to credit the photographer. If you have questions about photo credit requirements, contact the Foundation Communications Service Desk.\nPlain language\nWe could call out a few specific constructions that are needlessly wordy. One that we frequently catch at Ripple is \"in order to\" instead of just \"to.\"\nQuotation marks\nUse double quotation marks for dialogue and the citation of printed sources. Limit use of scare quotes—quotation marks meant to call attention to a quoted word or phrase and distance the author from its meaning, typically because the language is specialized, idiomatic, ironic, or misused. Example: The foundation has increasingly used “program-related investments” in recent years.\nQuoted strings and punctuation\nWhen describing exact strings in technical documentation, should punctuation (not part of the literal strings) be included in the quotation marks? For example, valid states include \"pending,\" \"in progress,\" and \"completed.\"\nScientific names\nCapitalize and italicize scientific names in accordance with conventions in the scientific community. Use the full version of a scientific name on first mention and the abbreviated form thereafter. For example, use Salmonella typhi first and S. typhi for each additional reference.\nSerial commas\nWith lists of three or more items in a sentence, add a final comma before the coordinating conjunction and or or. Example: The foundation's three program areas are Global Development, Global Health, and the United States.\nSpacing after punctuation\nUse only one space after punctuation, including periods, colons, and semicolons.\nSpelling and capitalization conventions\nbed net: two words, no hyphen.\nemail: one word, no hyphen, lowercase.\nfoundation: lowercase, except as part of the full foundation name.\ngrantmaking: one word, no hyphen.\nnongovernmental: one word, no hyphen.\nnonprofit: one word, no hyphen.\npostsecondary: one word, no hyphen.\nWashington state: lowercase state (unless you're referring to Washington State University, the Washington State Legislature, or something similar).\nwebsite: one word, lowercase\nTitles of people\nFormal titles should not be capitalized unless the title precedes a person's name or appears in a headline. Example: Co-chair Melinda Gates will speak at the Washington Economic Club this year.\nLowercase and spell out titles when they are not used with an individual's name. Example: The foundation co-chair issued a statement.\nLowercase and spell out titles in constructions that use commas to set them off from a name. Example: Bill Gates, co-chair of the foundation, commented on the grant.\nUnited States\nSpell out United States when using it as a noun. Abbreviate it as U.S. (including periods) when using it as an adjective. In certain cases, as when referring to a person from the United States, it's acceptable to use American.\nExamples: The U.S. State Department is in the United States. The foundation's U.S. Program…\nURL\nReference web addresses without the http:// as follows: www.gatesfoundation.org\n"},"contributors-guide/frequently-asked-questions.html":{"url":"contributors-guide/frequently-asked-questions.html","title":"Frequently Asked Questions","keywords":"","body":"Frequently Asked Questions\nThis document contains some of the most frequently asked questions from the community.\nTable of Content\n\nWhat is Mojaloop\nHow does it work\nWho is it for\nWhy does it exist\nWho's behind it\nWhat platforms does Mojaloop run on\nIs it really open-source\nHow can I contribute to Mojaloop\nWhat is supported\nCan we connect directly to Pathfinder in a development environment\nShould i register DFSP via url or update configuration in default.json\nStatus of the pod pi3-kafka-0 is still on CrashLoopBackOff\nWhy am I getting an error when we try to create new DFSP using Admin\nUsing Mojaloop to do payment using crypto-currency\nCan I spread Mojaloop components over different physical machines and VM's\nCan we expect for tall the endpoints defined in the API document are implemented in Mojaloop\nDoes Mojaloop store the payment initiator FSP’s quote/status info\nDoes Mojaloop handle workflow validation\nHow is the Mojaloop source accessible\nHow to register a new party in Mojaloop\nDoes the participant represent an account of a customer in a bank\nHow to register trusted payee to a payer, to skip OTP\nReceiving a 404 error when attempting to access or load kubernetes-dashboard.yaml file\nWhen installing nginx-ingress for load balancing & external access - Error: no available release name found\nReceived \"ImportError: librdkafka.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\" when running `npm start' command\nCan we use mojaloop as open-source mobile wallet software or mojaloop does interoperability only\nDescribe companies that helps to deploy & support for mojaloop\nCan you say something about mojaloop & security\nWhat are the benefit(s) from using mojaloop as interoperabilty platform\nWhat are the main challenges that companies face using mojaloop\nIs forensic logging/audit in mojaloop , is it related with securing the inter-operability platform\nHow do the financial service providers connect with mojaloop\nIs there any open source ISO8583-OpenAPI converter/connector available\nHow do I know the end points to setup postman for testing the deployment\nWhy are there no reversals allowed on a Mojaloop\nffg. error with microk8s installation \"MountVolume.SetUp failed\"\nWhy am I getting this error when trying to create a participant: \"Hub reconciliation account for the specified currency does not exist\"?\n\n1. What is Mojaloop?\nMojaloop is open-source software for building interoperable digital payments platforms on a national scale. It makes it easy for different kinds of providers to link up their services and deploy low-cost financial services in new markets.\n2. How does it work?\nMost digital financial providers run on their own networks, which prevents customers who use different services from transacting with each other. Mojaloop functions like a universal switchboard, routing payments securely between all customers, regardless of which network they're on. It consists of three primary layers, each with a specific function: an interoperability layer, which connects bank accounts, mobile money wallets, and merchants in an open loop; a directory service layer, which navigates the different methods that providers use to identify accounts on each side of a transaction; a transactions settlement layer, which makes payments instant and irrevocable; and components which protect against fraud.\n3. Who is it for?\nThere are many components to the code, and everyone either directly or indirectly working with digital financial transactions-fintech developers, bankers, entrepreneurs, startups-is invited to explore and use whatever parts are useful or appealing. The software as a whole is meant to be implemented on a national scale, and so it will be most applicable to mobile money providers, payments associations, central banks, and country regulators.\nDevelopers at fintech and financial services companies can use the code in three ways: adapt the code to the financial services standards for a country, use the code to update their own products and services or create new ones, and improve the code by proposing updates and new versions of it for other users.\nFor example:\n\nA central bank may commission the use of the software by their commercial partners to speed up the deployment of a national payment gateway.\nA major payment processor can use the software to modernize their current offering, to achieve lower transaction costs without major R&D investments.\nA fintech startup can use the code to understand practically how to comply with interoperable payment APIs.\nA bank can use the code to modify their internal systems so that they easily interoperate with other payment providers.\n\n4. Why does it exist?\nProviders trying to reach developing markets with innovative, low-cost digital financial services have to build everything on their own. This raises costs and segregates services from each other. Mojaloop can be used as a foundation to help build interoperable platforms, lowering costs for providers and allowing them to integrate their services with others in the market.\n5. Who's behind it?\nMojaloop was built in collaboration with a group of leading tech and fintech companies: Ripple, Dwolla, Software Group, ModusBox and Crosslake Technologies. Mojaloop was created by the Gates Foundation's Mojaloop, which is aimed at leveling the economic playing field by crowding in expertise and resources to build inclusive payment models to benefit the world's poor. It is free to the public as open-source software under the Apache 2.0 License.\n6. What platforms does Mojaloop run on?\nThe Mojaloop platform was developed for modern cloud-computing environments. Open-source methods and widely used platforms, like Node.js, serve as the foundation layer for Mojaloop. The microservices are packaged in Docker and can be deployed to local hardware or to cloud computing environments like Amazon Web Services or Azure.\n7. Is it really open-source?\nYes, it is really open-source. All core modules, documentation and white papers are available under a Apache 2.0 License. Mojaloop relies on commonly used open-source software, including node.js, MuleCE, Java and PostgreSQL. Mojaloop also uses the Interledger Protocol to choreograph secure money transfers. The licenses for all of these platforms and their imported dependencies allow for many viable uses of the software.\n8. How can I contribute to Mojaloop?\nYou can contribute by helping us create new functionality on our roadmap or by helping us improve the platform. For our roadmap, go to the Mojaloop Roadmap. We recommend starting with the onboarding guide and sample problem. This has been designed by the team to introduce the core ideas of the platform and software, the build methods, and our process for check-ins.\n9. What is supported?\nCurrently the Central ledger components are supported by the team. The DFSP components are outdated and thus the end-to-end environment and full setup is challenging to install.\n10. Can we connect directly to Pathfinder in a development environment?\nFor the local and test environment, we recommend interfacing with the 'mock-pathfinder' service instead. Pathfinder is a 'paid by usage' service. \nAccess the https://github.com/mojaloop/mock-pathfinder repository to download and install mock-pathfinder. Run command npm install in mock-pathfinder directory to install dependencies after this update Database_URI in mock-pathfinder/src/lib/config.js.\n11. Should i register DFSP via url http://central-directory/commands/register or i need to update configuration in default.json?\nYou should register using the API provided, using postman or curl. Client is using LevelOne code. Needs to implement the current Mojaloop release with the current Postman scripts.\n12. Status of the pod pi3-kafka-0 is still on CrashLoopBackOff?\n\nMore background related to the question:\nWhen I tired to get logs of the container centralledger-handler-admin-transfer, I get the following error:\nError from server (BadRequest): container \"centralledger-handler-admin-transfer\" in pod \"pi3-centralledger-handler-admin-transfer-6787b6dc8d-x68q9\" is waiting to start: PodInitializing\nAnd the status of the pod pi3-kafka-0 is still on CrashLoopBackOff.\nI am using a vps on ubuntu 16.04 with RAM 12GB, 2vCores, 2.4GHz, Rom 50GB at OVH for the deployment.\n\n\nIncreased RAM to 24 MB and CPU to 4 resolved the issues. Appears to be a timeout on Zookeeper due depletion of available resources, resulting in the services shutting down.\n13. Why am I getting an error when we try to create new DFSP using Admin?\nPlease insure you are using the most current Postman scripts available on https://github.com/mojaloop/mock-pathfinder repository.\n14. Using Mojaloop to do payment using crypto-currency?\nNot with the current Specification and with this platform. Currently this is limited to currencies listed in the ISO 4217. Since the specification and platform is all about digital transfers, it should be possible to investigate a use-case for this possible requirement. Alternatively, I guess an FSP can provide that conversion (like many do already from crypto to one of the listed currencies).\n15.  Can I spread Mojaloop components over different physical machines and VM's?\nYou should be able to setup on different VM's or physical machines. The distribution pretty much depend on your requirements and would be implementation specific. We utilise Kubernetes to assist with the Container Orchestration. This enables us to schedule the deployments through the Kubernetes runtime to specific machines if required, and request specific resources if required. The helm charts in the helm repository could be used as guideline to how best allocate and group the components in your deployment. Naturally you would need to update the configurations to complement your custom implementation.\n16. Can we expect for tall the endpoints defined in the API document are implemented in Mojaloop?\nThe Mojaloop Specification API for transfers and the Mojaloop Open Source Switch implementation are independent streams, though obviously the implementation is based on the Specification. Based on the use-cases prioritized for a time-frame and based on the end-points needed to support those use-cases, implementation will be done. If a few end-points are not prioritized then implementation for them may not be available. However, I think the goal is to eventually support all the end-points specified though it may take time. Thanks for the collection. We do have some of these on the ‘postman’ repo in the mojaloop GitHub org.\n17. Does Mojaloop store the payment initiator FSP’s quote/status info?\nAt the moment, the Mojaloop Open source Switch implementation does not store Quotes related information. The onus is on the Payer, Payee involved in the process to store the relevant information.\n18. Does Mojaloop handle workflow validation?\nNot at the moment, but this may happen in the future. Regarding correlating requests that are related to a specific transfer, you may look at the ‘transaction’ end-point/resource in the Specification for more information on this. In addition to this, I can convey that some background work is ongoing regarding the specification to make this correlation more straight-forward and simpler i.e., to correlate quote and transfer requests that come under a single transaction.\n19. How is the Mojaloop source accessible?\nHere are some resources to start with:\n\nDocs: https://github.com/mojaloop/documents. Note we are in the process to migrate from https://github.com/mojaloop/docs to https://github.com/mojaloop/documents.\nLook at the repos that have “CORE COMPONENT (Mojaloop)” in the description and these are core components. “CORE RELATED (Mojaloop)” repos are the ones that are needed to support the current Mojaloop Switch implementation/deployment.\nAs a generic point of note, for latest code, please use the ‘develop’ branch for the time-being.\nCurrent architecture: https://github.com/mojaloop/docs/tree/master/Diagrams/ArchitectureDiagrams. Please note that these are currently being migrated to https://github.com/mojaloop/documents.\nYou may use this for current deployment architecture and deployment information: https://github.com/mojaloop/documentation/tree/master/deployment-guide.\n\n20. How to register a new party in Mojaloop?\nThere is no  POST on /parties resource, as specified in section 6.1.1 of the API Defintion. Please refer to section: 6.2.2.3 POST /participants// in the API Defintion.\n” The HTTP request POST /participants// (or POST /participants///) is used to create information on the server regarding the provided identity, defined by , , and optionally  (for example, POST\n  /participants/MSISDN/123456789 or POST /participants/BUSINESS/shoecompany/employee1). See Section 5.1.6.11 for more information regarding addressing of a Party. ”.\n21. Does the participant represent an account of a customer in a bank?\nFor more on this, please refer to this doc (Section 3..2): https://github.com/mojaloop/mojaloop-specification/blob/develop/Generic%20Transaction%20Patterns.pdf.\n” In the API, a Participant is the same as an FSP that is participating in an Interoperability Scheme. The primary purpose of the logical API resource Participants is for FSPs to find out in which other FSP a counterparty in an interoperable financial transaction is located. There are also services defined for the FSPs to provision information to a common system. ”\nIn essence, a participant is any FSP participating in the Scheme (usually not a customer). For account lookup, a directory service such as Pathfinder can be used, which provides user lookup and the mapping. If such a directory service is not provided, an alternative is provided in the Specification, where the Switch hosts an Account Lookup Service (ALS) but to which the participants need to register parties. I addressed this earlier. But one thing to note here is that the Switch does not store the details, just the mapping between an ID and an FSP and then the calls to resolve the party are sent to that FSP. \nhttps://github.com/mojaloop/mojaloop-specification CORE RELATED (Mojaloop):\nThis repo contains the specification document set of the Open API for FSP Interoperability - mojaloop/mojaloop-specification.\n22. How to register trusted payee to a payer, to skip OTP?\nTo skip the OTP, the initial request on the /transactionRequests from the Payee can be programmatically (or manually for that matter) made to be approved without the use of the /authorizations endpoint (that is need for OTP approval). Indeed the FSP needs to handle this, the Switch does not. This is discussed briefly in section 6.4 of the Specification.\n23. Receiving a 404 error when attempting to access or load kubernetes-dashboard.yaml file?\nFrom the official kubernetes github repository in the README.md, the latest link to use is \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v1.10.1/src/deploy/recommended/kubernetes-dashboard.yaml\". Be sure to always verify 3rd party links before implementing. Open source applications are always evolving.\n24. When installing nginx-ingress for load balancing & external access - Error: no available release name found?\nPlease have a look at the following addressing a similar issue. To summarise - it is most likely an RBAC issue. Have a look at the documentation to set up Tiller with RBAC. https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#role-based-access-control goes into detail about this. The issue logged: helm/helm#3839.\n25. Received \"ImportError: librdkafka.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\" when running `npm start' command.\nFound a solution here https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-python/issues/65#issuecomment-269964346\nGitHub\nImportError: librdkafka.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory · Issue #65 · confluentinc/confluent-kafka-python\nUbuntu 14 here, pip==7.1.2, setuptools==18.3.2, virtualenv==13.1.2.

Contribute to edenhill/librdkafka development by creating an account on GitHub.\n26. Can we use mojaloop as open-source mobile wallet software or mojaloop does interoperability only?\nWe can use mojaloop for interoperability to support mobile wallet and other such money transfers. This is not a software for a DFSP (there are open source projects that cater for these such as Finserv etc). Mojaloop is for a Hub/Switch primarily and an API that needs to be implemented by a DFSP. But this is not for managing mobile wallets as such.\n27. Describe companies that helps to deploy & support for mojaloop?\nMojaloop is an open source software and specification.\n28. Can you say something about mojaloop & security?\nThe Specification is pretty standard and has good security standards. But these need to be implemented by the adopters and deployers. Along with this, the security measures need to be coupled with other Operational and Deployment based security measures. Moreover, the coming few months will focus on security perspective for the Open Source community.\n29. What are the benefit(s) from using mojaloop as interoperabilty platform?\nBenefits: Right now for example, an Airtel mobile money user can transfer to another Airtel mobile money user only. With this, he/she can transfer to any Financial service provider such as another mobile money provider or any other bank account or Merchant that is connected to the Hub, irrespective of their implementation. They just need to be connected to the same Switch. Also, this is designed for feature phones so everyone can use it.\n30. What are the main challenges that companies face using mojaloop?\nAt this point, the main challenges are around expectations. Expectations of the adopters of mojaloop and what really mojaloop is. A lot of adopters have different understanding of what mojaloop is and about its capabilities. If they have a good understanding, a lot of current challenges are mitigated..\nYes, forensic logging is a security measure as well for auditing purposes which will ensure there is audit-able log of actions and that everything that is a possible action of note is logged and rolled up, securely after encryption at a couple of levels.\n31. Is forensic logging/audit in mojaloop , is it related with securing the inter-operability platform?\nThis also ensures all the services always run the code they’re meant to run and anything wrong/bad is stopped from even starting up. Also, for reporting and auditors, reports can have a forensic-log to follow.\n32. How do the financial service providers connect with mojaloop?\nThere is an architecture diagram that presents a good view of the integration between the different entities. https://github.com/mojaloop/docs/blob/master/Diagrams/ArchitectureDiagrams/Arch-Flows.svg.\n33. Is there any open source ISO8583-OpenAPI converter/connector available?\nI don't believe a generic ISO8583  Mojaloop integration is available currently. We're working on some \"traditional payment channel\" to Mojaloop integrations (POS and ATM) which we hope to demo at the next convening. These would form the basis for an ISO8583 integration we might build and add to the OSS stack but bare in mind that these integrations will be very use case specific.\n34. How do I know the end points to setup postman for testing the deployment?\nOn the Kubernetes dashboard, select the correct NAMESPACE. Go to Ingeresses. Depending on how you deployed the helm charts, look for 'moja-centralledger-service'. Click on edit, and find the tag . This would contain the endpoint for this service.\n35. Why are there no reversals allowed on a Mojaloop?\nIrrevocability is a core Level One Principle (edited) and not allowing reversals is essential for that. Here is the section from the API Definition addressing this:\n6.7.1.2 Transaction Irrevocability\nThe API is designed to support irrevocable financial transactions only; this means that a financial transaction cannot be changed, cancelled, or reversed after it has been created. This is to simplify and reduce costs for FSPs using the API. A large percentage of the operating costs of a typical financial system is due to reversals of transactions.\nAs soon as a Payer FSP sends a financial transaction to a Payee FSP (that is, using POST /transfers including the end-to-end financial transaction), the transaction is irrevocable from the perspective of the Payer FSP. The transaction could still be rejected in the Payee FSP, but the Payer FSP can no longer reject or change the transaction. An exception to this would be if the transfer’s expiry time is exceeded before the Payee FSP responds (see Sections 6.7.1.3 and 6.7.1.5 for more information). As soon as the financial transaction has been accepted by the Payee FSP, the transaction is irrevocable for all parties.\nHowever, Refunds is a use case supported by the API.\n36. ffg. error with microk8s installation \"MountVolume.SetUp failed\"?\nWould appear if it is a space issue, but more the 100GiB of EBS storage was allocated.\nThe issue resolved itself after 45 minutes. Initial implementation of the mojaloop project can take a while to stabilize.\n37. Why am I getting this error when trying to create a participant: \"Hub reconciliation account for the specified currency does not exist\"?\nYou need to create the corresponding Hub accounts (HUB_MULTILATERAL_SETTLEMENT and HUB_RECONCILIATION) for the specified currency before setting up the participants. \nIn this Postman collection you can find the requests to perform the operation in the \"Hub Account\" folder: https://github.com/mojaloop/postman/blob/master/OSS-New-Deployment-FSP-Setup.postman_collection.json\nFind also the related environments in the Postman repo: https://github.com/mojaloop/postman\n"},"mojaloop-technical-overview/":{"url":"mojaloop-technical-overview/","title":"Mojaloop Technical Overview","keywords":"","body":"Mojaloop Technical Overview\nMojaloop Services\nThe basic idea behind Mojaloop is that we need to connect multiple Digital Financial Services Providers (DFSPs) together into a competitive and interoperable network in order to maximize opportunities for poor people to get access to financial services with low or no fees. We don't want a single monopoly power in control of all payments in a country, or a system that shuts out new players. It also doesn't help if there are too many isolated subnetworks. The following diagrams shows the Mojaloop interconnects between DFSPs and the Mojaloop Hub (schema implementation example) for a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Transfer:\nMojaloop addresses these issues in several key ways:\n\nA set of central services provides a hub through which money can flow from one DFSP to another. This is similar to how money moves through a central bank or clearing house in developed countries. Besides a central ledger, central services can provide identity lookup, fraud management, and enforce scheme rules.\nA standard set of interfaces a DFSP can implement to connect to the system, and example code that shows how to use the system. A DFSP that wants to connect up can adapt our example code or implement the standard interfaces into their own software. The goal is for it to be as straightforward as possible for a DFSP to connect to the interoperable network.\nComplete working open-source implementations of both sides of the interfaces - an example DFSP that can send and receive payments and the client that an existing DFSP could host to connect to the network.\n\n\nThe Mojaloop Hub is the primary container and reference we use to describe the Mojaloop echo-system which is split in to the following domains:\n\nMojaloop Open Source Services - Core Mojaloop Open Source Software (OSS) that has been supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in partnership with the Open Source Community.\nMojaloop Hub - Overall Mojaloop reference (and customizable) implementation for Hub Operators is based on the above OSS solution.\n\n"},"mojaloop-technical-overview/overview/":{"url":"mojaloop-technical-overview/overview/","title":"Mojaloop Hub","keywords":"","body":"Mojaloop Hub\nThere are several components that make up the Mojaloop ecosystem.

A DFSP that wants to connect up can adapt our example code or implement the standard interfaces into their own software. The goal is for it to be as straightforward as possible for a DFSP to connect to the interoperable network.\nThe Central Services (CS) provide the set of components required to move money from one DFSP to another through the Mojaloop API Adapters. This is similar to how money moves through a central bank or clearing house in developed countries. The Central Services contains the core Central Ledger logic to move money but also will be extended to provide fraud management and enforce scheme rules.\nThe Account Lookup Service (ALS) provides mechanism to resolve FSP routing information through the Particpant API or orchestrate a Party request based on an internal Participant look-up. The internal Participant look-up is handled by a number of standard Oracle adapter or services. Example Oracle adapter/service would be to look-up Participant information from Pathfinder or a Merchant Registry. These Oracle adapter or services can easily be added depending on the schema requirements.\nThe Quoting Service (QA) provides Quoting is the process that determines any fees and any commission required to perform a financial transaction between two FSPs. It is always initiated by the Payer FSP to the Payee FSP, which means that the quote flows in the same way as a financial transaction.\nThe Simulator (SIM) mocks several DFSP functions as follows:\nOracle end-points for Oracle Participant CRUD operations using in-memory cache;\nParticipant end-points for Oracles with support for parameterized partyIdTypes;\nParties end-points for Payer and Payee FSPs with associated callback responses;\nTransfer end-points for Payer and Payee FSPs with associated callback responses; and\nQuery APIs to verify transactions (requests, responses, callbacks, etc) to support QA testing and verification.\n\n\n\nOn either side of the Mojaloop Hub there is sample open source code to show how a DFSP can send and receive payments and the client that an existing DFSP could host to connect to the network.\n"},"mojaloop-technical-overview/overview/components-PI5.html":{"url":"mojaloop-technical-overview/overview/components-PI5.html","title":"Legacy Architecture - PI5","keywords":"","body":"Mojaloop Hub Legacy Components - PI5\nThe following component diagram shows the break-down of the Mojaloop services and its micro-service architecture for pre PI5: \n\nNote: Colour-grading indicates the relationship between data-store, and message-streaming / adapter-interconnects.

Design Considerations\n1.1. Account Lookup Service (ALS)\nThe ALS design provides a generic Central-Service component as part of the core Mojaloop. The purpose of this component is to provide routing and alignment to the Mojaloop API Specification. This component will support multiple Look-up registries (Oracles). This ALS will provide an Admin API to configure routing/config for each of the Oracles similiar to the Central-Service API for the End-point configuration for DFSP routing by the Notification-Handler (ML-API-Adapter Component). The ALS will in all intense purpose be a switch with a persistence store for the storage/management of the routing rules/config.\n1.1.1. Assumptions\n\nThe ALS design will only cater for a single switch for the time being.\nSupport for multiple switches will utilise the same DNS resolution mechanism that is being developed for the Cross Border/Network design.\n\n1.1.2. Routing\nThe routing configuration will be based on the following:\n\nPartyIdType - See section 7.5.6 of the Mojaloop Specification\nCurrency - See section 7.5.5 of the Mojaloop Specification. Currency code defined in ISO 4217 as three-letter alphabetic string. This will be optional, however isDefault indicator must be set to true if the Currency is not provided.\nisDefault - Indicator that a specific Oracle is the default provider for a specific PartyIdType. Note that there can be many default Oracles, but there can only be a single Oracle default for a specific PartyIdType. The default Oracle for a specific PartyIdType will only be selected if the originating request does not include a Currency filter.\n\n1.2. ALS Oracle\nThe ALS Oracle be implemented as either a Service or Adapter (semantic dependant on use - Mediation = Adapter, Service = Implementation) will provide a look-up registry component with similar functionality of the /participants Mojaloop API resources. It has however loosely based on the ML API specification as it's interface implements a sync pattern which reduces the correlation/persistence requirements of the Async Callback pattern implemented directly by the ML API Spec. This will provide all ALS Oracle Services/Adapters with a standard interface which will be mediated by the ALS based on its routing configuration.This component (or back-end systems) will also be responsible for the persistence & defaulting of the Participant details.\n2.

For details (refer to section 6.10) as per the Mojaloop Specification\n\nIntroduction\nDesign Considerations\nSteps involved in the high-level Architecture\nNotes\nDiscussion items\nProposed new tables\nBulk Transfers States\nAdditional Notes\n\n\nRoadmap Topics\n\n1. Introduction\nThe Bulk Transfers process is discussed in section 6.10 of the API Definition 1.0 document, depicted in Figure 60, of which a snapshot is posted below.\n\nThe key items implied in the specification in its current version 1.0 are that\n\nReservation of funds is done for each individual transfer from the Payer FSP to the Payee FSP\nEven if a single individual transfer fails during the prepare process, the whole bulk is to be rejected.\n\n2. Design Considerations\nAccording to the Figure-60 of the specification, below are a few key implications from the Specification.\n\nThe Payer DFSP performs user look-ups for the individual parties involved in the bulk payment separately\nThe Payer DFSP performs bulk quoting per Payee DFSP\nThe onus is on the Payer DFSP to prepare bulk transfers based on Payee FSPs and send out a bulk transfer request to a single Payee FSP\nThis seems to be an all-or-nothing process where even if a single individual transfer fails to be reserved, then the whole bulk needs to be rejected because it cannot be sent to the Payee as it is if it has an individual transfer for which funds couldn't be reserved.\nIn light of the above, the proposal being made right now is to empower the Switch (needs updating the Specification) to send out the POST /bulkTransfers request with the list of individual transfers for which funds were able to be reserved on the Switch.\nThe implication is that the Switch aggregates commits/failures from the Payee FSP for the bulk and sends out a single PUT /bulkTransfers/{ID} call to the Payer FSP that includes the entire list of transfers that includes individual transfers that failed both at the Switch and the Payee FSP\nFor example: If there are 1000 individual transfers in a Bulk Transfer and if the Switch is able to reserve funds for 900 of the individual transfers, then a prepare bulk transfer request to the Payee DFSP is sent with the list of those 900 individual transfers. Once the Payee FSP sends the Bulk Fulfil request for those 900 transfers of which lets say, 800 can be committed and 100 are aborted, then the Switch processes those individual transfers accordingly and sends out the PUT callback (PUT /bulkTransfers/{ID}) notification to the Payer FSP with all the 1000 individual transfers, 800 of which are committed and 200 of which are aborted.\nThere will be implications to aspects such as Signature, Encryption, PKI and other security aspects that will need to be addressed.\nThe ordering of the individual transfers need to be considered as well by the Scheme. A Goal for implementation in emerging markets is to maximize the number of transactions involved and so a well designed Scheme may re-order individual transfers in the ascending order of the magnitude of amounts and then process them. But this can be a Scheme consideration.\nHowever, a recommended Scheme Rule is that the Payee FSPs shouldn't be allowed to re-order the individual transfers in a bulk to avoid bias towards Payee parties.\nFor Settlements with bulk transfers where Government payments are involved with large sums of money needs to be discussed to allow for moving through transfers without strict liquidity rules needs to be discussed.\n\n3. Steps involved in the high-level Architecture\nBelow are the steps involved at a high level for bulk transfers.\n  \n\n[1.0, 1.1, 1.2] An Incoming bulk Transfer request (POST /bulkTransfers) on the ml-api-adapter is placed in an object store and a notification with a reference to the actual message is sent via a kafka topic “bulk prepare” and a 202 is sent to the Payer FSP  \n[1.3] Bulk Prepare handler consumes the request, records the status as RECEIVED   a. Bulk Prepare handler then validates the Bulk and changes state to PENDING if the validation is successful  \n b. One validation rule proposed in addition, here is to reject a bulk if there are duplicate transfer IDs used in the bulk itself.\n c. [1.4] If validation fails, Bulk Prepare handler changes the bulkTransferState to Pending_Rejected (an internal state) and produces a message onto the bulk processing topic  \n     i. Bulk processing Handler then updates the bulkTransferState to REJECTED and sends a notification to the Payer  \n\n[1.4] [Continuing 2.a] Bulk Prepare handler breaks down the bulk into individual transfers and puts each of them on the prepare topic   a. As part of this, each transfer is individually assigned the 'expiration time' of the bulk Transfer itself (and other fields necessary for individual transfers)  \n\n[1.5, 1.6, 1.7] Prepare handler, Position handler are refactored to handle individual transfers in a bulk, using flags such as type, action, status, etc. a. Reservation of funds --> This is left to the individual handlers and the whole bulk is then aggregated in the Bulk Processing Handler.  \n\n[1.8] Position Handler produces messages corresponding to individual transfers that are part of a bulk to bulk processing topic  \n[1.9] For every message consumed from the bulk processing topic a check is made on the Bulk processing Handler to see if that’s the last individual transfer in a bulk for that processing phase.\n[1.10, 1.11, 1.12] If it is the last transfer, aggregate the state of all the individual transfers and   a. If all of them are in reserved state --> Send POST /bulkTransfers to the Payee (by producing a message to the notifications topic which is then consumed by the notification handler)  \n b. Once the bulkTransfer prepare request is sent to the Payee, then change status to ACCEPTED  \n\nIn a successful case of Prepare - when the PUT from the Payee FSP for bulkFulfil is received, a notification is put on the bulk fulfil topic with a reference to the actual Fulfil message that's stored in an Object store.  \nThis is to be consumed by the bulkFulfilHandler, which then changes state to PROCESSING.  \nThe bulk-fulfil-handler breaks down the bulk into individual transfers and sends each of them through the refactored Fulfil, Position Handlers to commit/abort each of them based on the PUT /bulkTransfers/{ID} message by the Payee and commit/release funds on the Switch  \nThe bulk-processing-handler is to then aggregate all the individual transfer results and change the state of bulkTransfer to COMPLETED/REJECTED based on success/failure  a. If the Payee sends COMMITTED for even one of the individual transfers the proposal is to change bulk state to COMPLETED.  \nb. However, for step-8 or if the Payee sends REJECTED as bulkTransferState then final state on Switch should be REJECTED.  \n\nSend notifications to both Payer and Payee (similar to Single transfers, though diverging from the Spec 1.0). The Payer-FSP receives the notification that includes an exhaustive list of individual transfers, same as the list present in the prepare request sent by the Payer. The Payee-FSP receives a notification only for sub-set of transfers, which were sent to it from the Switch as the Bulk prepare request (that were able to be reserved at the Switch).  \n\n4. Implementation Details\n4.1 Bulk Transfer States\nBelow are the states of a Bulk transfer as per the Mojaloop API Specification\n\nRECEIVED  \nPENDING  \nACCEPTED  \nPROCESSING  \nCOMPLETED  \nREJECTED\nInternal state - INVALID (mapped to REJECTED)\nMicro-states to be added for internal use on the Switch\n\n4.2 Proposed New tables\nBelow are the proposed tables as part of designing the Bulk transfers\n\nbulkTransfer  \nbulkTransferStateChange  \nbulkTransferError  \nbulkTransferDuplicateCheck\nbulkTransferFulfilment\nbulkTransferFulfilmentDuplicateCheck\nbulkTransferAssociation  \nbulkTransferExtension  \nbulkTransferParticipant\nbulkTransferState  \nbulkProcessingState  \nLink to the ERD from the PR: https://github.com/elnyry/documentation/blob/feature/738-bulk-transfers-design-changes/mojaloop-technical-overview/central-bulk-transfers/assets/database/central-ledger-schema.png\n\n4.3 Internal Type-Action-Status combinations\n1.

Recommendation to Scheme to incorporate Rule to mandate all FSPs to process transactions a bulk in the existing order and not have preferential processing. On the Switch currently being neutral with ordering but best practice is to sort in ascending order of amounts and process.\nFor Settlements with bulk transfers where Government payments are involved with large sums of money needs to be discussed to allow for moving through transfers without strict liquidity rules needs to be discussed.\n\n"},"mojaloop-technical-overview/central-bulk-transfers/transfers/1.1.0-bulk-prepare-transfer-request-overview.html":{"url":"mojaloop-technical-overview/central-bulk-transfers/transfers/1.1.0-bulk-prepare-transfer-request-overview.html","title":"Bulk

Tracing Design\n4.1 HTTP Transports\nBelow find the current proposed standard HTTP Transport headers for tracing.\nMojaloop has yet to standardise on either standard, or if it will possible support both.\n4.1.1 WC3 Http Headers\nRefer to the following publication for more information: https://w3c.github.io/trace-context/\n\n\n\nHeader\nDescription\nExample\n\n\n\n\ntraceparent\nDash delimited string of tracing information: \\-\\-\\-\\\n00-4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736-00f067aa0ba902b7-00\n\n\ntracestate\nComma delimited vendor specific format captured as follows: \\=\\\ncongo=t61rcWkgMzE,rojo=00f067aa0ba902b7\n\n\n\nNote: Before this specification was written, some tracers propagated X-B3-Sampled as true or false as opposed to 1 or 0. While you shouldn't encode X-B3-Sampled as true or false, a lenient implementation may accept them.\n4.1.2 B3 HTTP Headers\nRefer to the following publication for more information: https://github.com/apache/incubator-zipkin-b3-propagation\n\n\n\nHeader\nDescription\nExample\n\n\n\n\nX-B3-TraceId\nEncoded as 32 or 16 lower-hex characters.\na 128-bit TraceId header might look like: X-B3-TraceId: 463ac35c9f6413ad48485a3953bb6124. Unless propagating only the Sampling State, the X-B3-TraceId header is required.\n\n\nX-B3-SpanId\nEncoded as 16 lower-hex characters.\na SpanId header might look like: X-B3-SpanId: a2fb4a1d1a96d312. Unless propagating only the Sampling State, the X-B3-SpanId header is required.\n\n\nX-B3-ParentSpanId\nheader may be present on a child span and must be absent on the root span. It is encoded as 16 lower-hex characters.\nA ParentSpanId header might look like: X-B3-ParentSpanId: 0020000000000001\n\n\nX-B3-Sampled\nAn accept sampling decision is encoded as 1 and a deny as 0. Absent means defer the decision to the receiver of this header.\nA Sampled header might look like: X-B3-Sampled: 1.\n\n\nX-B3-Flags\nDebug is encoded as 1. Debug implies an accept decision, so don't also send the X-B3-Sampled header.\n\n\n\n4.2 Kafka Transports\nRefer to Event Envelope Model section. This defines the message that will be sent through the Kafka transport.\nAlternatively the tracing context could be stored in Kafka headers which are only supports v0.11 or later. Note that this would break support for older versions of Kafka.\n4.3 Known limitations\n\nTransfer tracing would be limited to each of the transfer legs (i.e. Prepare and Fulfil) as a result of the Mojaloop API specification not catering for tracing information. The trace information will be send as part of the callbacks by the Switch, but the FSPs will not be required to respond appropriately with a reciprocal trace headers.\n\n"},"mojaloop-technical-overview/fraud-services/":{"url":"mojaloop-technical-overview/fraud-services/","title":"Fraud Services","keywords":"","body":"Fraud Services\nProvides an overview of the monitoring and preventative measures in consideration to prevent and discourage fraudulent activities within the Mojaloop ecosystem.\nRelevant artefacts available for public consumption are shared within related-documents section.\n"},"mojaloop-technical-overview/fraud-services/related-documents/documentation.html":{"url":"mojaloop-technical-overview/fraud-services/related-documents/documentation.html","title":"Ecosystem Fraud Documentation","keywords":"","body":"Fraud Services\nArtefacts available for public reference related to the preventative measures in preventing and discouraging fraudulent activities within the ecosystem.\nList of current artefacts\nMojaloop Ecosystem Fraud Overview Document\n"},"api/":{"url":"api/","title":"API Specifications","keywords":"","body":"API Specifications\nMojaloop API\nDocumentation: Mojaloop Specification\n\nMojaloop API v1.0 Specification\nSwagger\n\nVersions\n\n\n\nVersion\nInfo\nRelease Date\n\n\n\n\n1.0\nInitial release\n2018-11-01\n\n\n\nCentral Ledger API\nDocumentation: Central-Ledger Service\n\nCentral Ledger API v2.0 Specification\nSwagger\n\nVersions\n\n\n\nVersion\nInfo\nRelease Date\n\n\n\n\n3.8.3.1\nFeature/#538 FundsIn/Out Position Changes\n2018-12-11\n\n\n3.8.3\nInitial release\n2018-11-02\n\n\n\nCentral Settlements API\nDocumentation: Central-Settlements Service\n\nCentral Settlements API v1.1 Specification\nSwagger\n\nVersions\n\n\n\nVersion\nInfo\nRelease Date\n\n\n\n\n1.1\nImplementation driven corrections\n2019-04-03\n\n\n1.0\nInitial release\n2018-08-31\n\n\n\nALS Oracle API\nDocumentation: Account-Lookup Service\n\nALS Oracle API v1.2 Specification\nSwagger\n\nNotes:\n\nALS Oracle API is based on the Mojaloop Specification with the following main differences:\nOperations follow traditional REST API paradigms more strictly.\nOperations are synchronous with an immediate response unlike Mojaloop Specification which provides a responds via asynchronous callbacks.\nPUT /participants is to update existing records and not a Callback as per the Mojaloop Specification\nGET /participants response body returns a list of Participants, containing currency.\nPOST /participants request body includes the currency as part of each record. \n\n\n\nVersions\n\n\n\nVersion\nInfo\nRelease Date\n\n\n\n\n1.2\nRemoval of duplicated currency from POST /participants payload.\n2019-05-20 \n\n\n1.1\nPUT /participants/{Type}/{ID} returns a HTTP 204 - No Content on success.

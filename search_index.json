Overview","keywords":"","body":"Mojaloop Overview\n\n\n\nMojaloop is open source software for creating digital payments platforms that connect all customers, merchants, banks, and other financial providers in a country's economy. Rather than a financial product or application in itself, Mojaloop establishes a blueprint for technology that bridges all the financial products and applications in any given market.\nThe basic idea behind Mojaloop is that we need to connect multiple Digital Financial Services Providers (DFSPs) together into a competitive and interoperable network in order to maximize opportunities for poor people to get access to financial services with low or no fees. We don't want a single monopoly power in control of all payments in a country, or a system that shuts out new players. It also doesn't help if there are too many isolated subnetworks.\n\nOur model addresses these issues in several key ways:\n\nA set of central services provides a hub through which money can flow from one DFSP to another. This is similar to how money moves through a central bank or clearing house in developed countries. Besides a central ledger, central services can provide identity lookup, fraud management, and enforce scheme rules.\nA standard set of interfaces a DFSP can implement to connect to the system, and example code that shows how to use the system. A DFSP that wants to connect up can adapt our example code or implement the standard interfaces into their own software. The goal is for it to be as straightforward as possible for a DFSP to connect to the interoperable network.\nComplete working open-source implementations of both sides of the interfaces - an example DFSP that can send and receive payments and the client that an existing DFSP could host to connect to the network.\n\nThe intention for the Mojaloop project is for financial institutions and commercial providers to use the open-source software to help build digital, interoperable payments platforms that drive financial inclusion on a national scale. Specifically, the platforms will enable seamless, low-cost transactions between individual users, merchants, banks, providers, and even government offices - helping connect poor customers with everyone else in the digital economy.\n"},"mojaloop-background/":{"url":"mojaloop-background/","title":"Mojaloop Background","keywords":"","body":"Mojaloop Background\nMojaloop Background\nMojaloop grew out of principles set forth by the Financial Services for the Poor team at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. These principles form the cornerstone of the Level One Project, which is the foundation's initiative for designing and implementing digital financial services and systems to include and benefit the world's 2 billion unbanked. The code won't address the gap in digital financial services on its own, but it can help service providers open markets and accelerate progress.\nDigital and mobile technologies make it possible to reach new customers in developing markets with innovative, low-cost financial services. The lack of a shared platform, though, means that financial providers have to build everything on their own. This raises costs and keeps the digital financial industry from growing and innovating as fast as it could.\nWith support and funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Mojaloop was designed by a team of leading tech and fintech companies: Ripple, Dwolla, ModusBox, Software Group, Coil, and Crosslake Technologies. It is available now as an open-source project. Free to be used and adapted by anyone under the Apache 2.0 license. For more information on how Mojaloop ties into the larger initiative of financial inclusion, visit LevelOneProject.org.\n"},"mojaloop-background/core-scenarios.html":{"url":"mojaloop-background/core-scenarios.html","title":"Core Scenarios","keywords":"","body":"Core Scenarios\nAbout Mojaloop Scenarios\nMojaloop addresses a number of scenarios in which this software might help the poor to meet their financial and banking needs. There are several different paths for each of these scenarios, including potential timeout issues and reversals (which are handled as a separate transaction). The most common paths include:\n\nSend money to anyone\nBuy goods\nBulk Payments\nTier Risk Levels\nFraud Checks and Blacklists\nAccount Management\nCheck Account and POS\n\nScenario Descriptions\nSend money to anyone\nHamim is working on his farm in Northern Uganda when he receives an urgent phone call from his brother, Kani. Kani is low on money and will not get paid until next week. Kani has no money to pay for food for his family and asks Hamim to help him out. Hamim and Kani have no means of transportation and it would take several days for Hamim to get to his Kani's home in Southern Uganda. While they both have mobile flip phones, they use different financial service providers. Kani tells Hamim that he needs 5,000 shillings to buy food until he gets paid next week for his job working in a local field. Hamin agrees to send Kani the money.\n        *** Mojaloop technology does its job ***\n\nBecause Hamim has sent money to Kani before he has his information on his phone. Hamim sees Kani's name come up on his phone and he starts the transaction. He also sees the total fees and any exchange rates he has to pay before he sends the money. He is happy for that validation and that the transaction goes the same way every time. In under 30 seconds, Hamim is able to send the money to his Kani and verifies that he got it. Hamim is happy he was able to help out Kani and his family so quickly so they can buy food.\nBuy Goods\nVenya is waiting in line to buy plantains at her local market. She is corralling her elder child with one hand and has her baby in a sling. She often comes to this seller and she knows he has a good price. She also knows that even though she carries no money and he is not on her financial network, she can buy from him. As she approaches the head of the line she juggles the children and pulls out a simple flip phone. She tells him 1.5 kilograms and he tells her the price, which she agrees to.\n        *** Mojaloop technology does its job ***\n\nBecause she's been here before the merchant already has her information on his phone. The only information he has is her user number. This makes Venya feel safe that the merchant does not have her mobile phone number. The merchant enters in the amount for the plantains. Almost instantaneously, Venya sees the merchants invoice on her phone and she is glad she is able to pay for the transaction using her mWallet account. She is happy that the transaction goes the same way every time, because half of her attention is on the children. She has friends who can't read and they are able to buy things this way too by following the simple order of the transaction. In under 30 seconds, she is able to send the money to the merchant and both Venya and the merchant get confirmation of the transaction. She tells the elder child to pick up her plantains and makes room for the next person in line.\nBulk Payments\nNikisha is the accountant for one of the largest manufacturing companies in Johannesburg and employs over 250 workers. Their company uses a time and attendance system to track the number of hours that each employee works along with their hourly rate and employee ID. On a weekly basis Nikisha gets an update on her bulk payment system that shows all the employees, their user ID along and amount to be paid. Since the companies employees all have different financial service providers this system makes it really easy for Nikisha to confirm and distribute their pay with a couple of clicks. The company has a high turnover rate so new employees who get their first paycheck are automatically prompted to open an account as long as they provided a valid mobile number when they started. As Nikisha gets ready to send out this week's payments she opens up a bulk payment report.\n*** Mojaloop technology does its job ***\n\nThe bulk report for payments comes up by date range and, since Nikisha does this weekly, there are several items she needs to verify each time. Specifically, she looks for any errors or alerts for employees with invalid phone numbers, names not matching or other anomalies. Nikisha has the ability to follow-up with her co-workers or employees directly to fix these errors before sending out the payments. In addition, Nikisha is also notified of any employees who don't have an account setup. For these users, Nikisha is still able to push a payment through and the employee will be prompted by text message to open an account. Nikisha is thankful she has this process that makes it much easier to distribute funds. Once Nikisha has completed her validation, she sends it to her supervisor for final approval. Nikisha is glad to have this system in place because several years ago, Nikisha and her supervisor had to pay employees in cash and use a manual system to verify payments were received which made her feel very uneasy.\nTier Risk Levels\nSalem works as an auditor for a large bank in Kampala, Uganda. His job is to monitor, manage and reduce risk for the company. order to do so each new user ID in the system is assigned a default tier level which means they can only transfer a small number and amount of funds in and out of the system over specific periods of time. As users acquire greater balances in their accounts and hold their accounts for longer periods of time their tier levels improve. Tier levels are handled automatically by the system so Salem does not need to worry about assigning or changing these levels under normal circumstances. Part of Salem's job as an auditor is to review the daily reports to ensure that everyone's funds are safe and secure and he kicks off his daily report to review the accounts.\n*** Mojaloop technology does its job ***\n\nThis morning when Salem reviews these reports he notices that one specific user ID has 32 outgoing transactions in one day which exceeds their daily count of 25. This seems very suspicious to Salem and he goes ahead and contacts the customer. It turns out that this customer is a local merchant that owns a store. The merchant explains that he has to go to the market on a weekly basis to get ingredients for his restaurant and it is not uncommon for him and his staff to make more than 25 purchases in one day. Although this customer has only been with Salem's bank for a month then have a healthy balance in their account. Salem goes ahead and upgrades the customers tier level to increase the daily and weekly transaction counts.\nFraud Checks and Blacklists\nSalem works as an auditor for a large bank in Kampala, Uganda. His job is to monitor and stop any fraudulent activity for the company. While the company has a set of rules that might flag individuals for Salem to investigate, he also has the authority to screen any user ID for fraudulent activities at any time. Each time Salem performs a fraud check on a user ID, the system records the date of the last check along with any comments that Salem might have made. This makes it very easy for Salem to search for IDs that might have never been checked for fraud or have not been checked in a very long time. Salem has been monitoring one particular ID that seems to have had an increased amount of incoming funds deposited into their account on a daily basis. Today he does a search of the user ID to investigate further.\n*** Mojaloop technology does its job ***\n\nWhen the user ID is retrieved Salem is able to see the customer's name, birthdate and national ID number. He also sees any additional IDs and the account type associated with this customer. Upon further inspection Salem sees once again the number and amount of transactions deposited into this account has doubled again today. Salem suspects that this user is involved in some illegal activity and would like to send this up to his supervisor to get someone to do a deeper investigation. In the meantime to ensure that the illegal funds don't continue to come into the system, Salem decides to 'freeze' the account. Salem does this by checking the blacklist button and indicating a reason for the blacklist. At this point any future deposits or withdrawals for this User ID will be denied until someone from the Bank removes them from the blacklist. Salem feels good that no additional funds that might of come from illegal or unapproved sources will be deposited into this customer account.\nAccount Management\nTadeo just bought his first mobile flip phone for him and his family to share. He is happy that he finally has a phone that he can use in emergencies, but he can also finally keep his money secure by opening up a bank account. Tadeo has never had a bank account since he lives in a very remote part of Africa with no personal means of transportation. Tadeo and his family have to rely on bartering or cash to buy any goods they need at the market. Although Tadeo is not proficient in reading, he is able to easily use his phone to setup and account for him and his family by following a couple of easy to read menu steps.\n*** Mojaloop technology does its job ***\n\nTadeo was able to use his phone to create an mWallet account using his National ID. He was also asked to create a unique pin which made him feel secure in case him or someone in the family lost the phone. Tadeo is the primary account owner and he was able to easily create a new account for his oldest son. He was very pleased that he could have separate accounts for his son. His son is married and lives with Tadeo but does not have a phone. Since his son works it is only fair that they should be able to spend his money on goods and foods that he and his wife prefer. Tadeo also adds his wife as a user on his account. He allows his wife to be a signatory since she does most of the shopping at the local market and now has the ability to pay for goods using this phone. Tadeo is very happy that his wife no longer needs to have cash or carry barter goods to the market.\nCheck Account and POS\nJahari has a flip phone that all the family uses and he has setup different user numbers for each family member. Jahari is at the local market and needs to buy some meat for his family. Before he does, he wants to make sure he has enough funds in his account to purchase the goods and still have enough left over to set aside for future medical expenses and education. Jahari is happy that his money is secure and he is able to check his account balance anytime he needs to by simply entering his secure pin on his phone. Once he confirms his balance he will buy some goat and cow meat at the market.\n    *** Mojaloop technology does its job ***\n\nAfter Jahari has entered his pin on his phone he is able to see his account balance. He is also able to see any of his recent transactions as well as any fees that were associated with these transactions. After confirming his available funds he picks out his meat and brings it up to the merchant for payment. The merchant does a lot of business in this market and has a point of sales device. This is very helpful for Jahari and his family since they only have one phone and many times his wife or his children go to the market and do not have the phone with them. Jahari can generate a one time pin for family to use in these cases. The merchant is able to enter the purchase amount on the POS device and Jahari or any of his family members securely enters their user number and reviews the transaction. He confirms that the amount on the POS machine matches what the merchant verbally told him and he enters his one-time pin to approve the transaction.\n*** Mojaloop technology does its job ***\n\nThe merchant gets confirmation that he received payment and he prints a receipt for Jahari. Jahari also receives a text notification on his phone confirming the transaction has completed and including the transaction details. And since Jahari has his phone with him today he also re-checks his account balance again to confirm that appropriate funds were taken from his account. Jahari is happy that this is an easy process and he can see that he has plenty of money left to set aside this month for his family to use on education or health expenses.\n"},"mojaloop-background/level-one-principles.html":{"url":"mojaloop-background/level-one-principles.html","title":"Level One Principles","keywords":"","body":"Level One Principles\nThe Level One Project Guide outlines a vision of how an inclusive digital financial services system can work for the benefit of poor people.

Environment recommendations\nThis environment setup was validated on:\n\n64-bit version of Ubuntu Bionic 18.04(LTS).\nThis guide is based on Ubuntu 18.04.2 (bionic) on a x86_64 desktop with 8 CPU's and 16GB RAM.\n\n2. Kubernetes\nKubernetes installation for a local environment.\n2.1. MicroK8S\nWe recommend install directly from the snap store.\nDon't have the snap command? Install snapd first.\n\nInstalling MicroK8s from snap.\nsnap install microk8s --classic\n\n\nVerify MicroK8s is installed and available.\nmicrok8s.status\n\n\nDuring installation you can use the --wait-ready flag to wait for the kubernetes services to initialise.\nmicrok8s.status --wait -ready\n\n\nTo avoid colliding with a kubectl already installed and to avoid overwriting any existing Kubernetes configuration file, MicroK8s adds a microk8s.kubectl command, configured to exclusively access the new MicroK8s install.\nmicrok8s.kubectl get services\n\n\nThis step is only necessary if you require microk8s.kubectl to function as a standard kubectl command. This DOES NOT mean that you can then use kubectl to access OTHER k8s clusters.\nAn example of why you would use this: You have a bash script or 3rd party tool that expects kubectl to be available. E.g. If you want to use Helm, it will not work against microk8s.kubectl, thus one MUST setup the alias for Helm to function correctly.\nsnap alias microk8s.kubectl kubectl\n\nReverting it at any time;\nsnap unalias kubectl\n\nWe will stick with the standard command of prefixing with microk8s. for this guide.\n\nIf you already have kubectl installed and would like to use it to access the MicroK8s deployment.\nmicrok8s.kubectl config view --raw > $HOME/.kube/config\n\n\nView the current context.\nmicrok8s.kubectl config get-contexts\n\n\nMake sure the current context is microk8s. If not, set it as the current context.\nmicrok8s.kubectl config use-context microk8s\n\n\n\n1.2. Docker\nDocker is deployed as part of the MicroK8s installation. The docker daemon used by MicroK8s is listening on unix:///var/snap/microk8s/current/docker.sock. You can access it with the microk8s.docker command.\n\nIf you require microk8s.docker to function as a standard docker command, you set an alias.\nsudo snap alias microk8s.docker docker\n\nUndo the alias;\nsudo snap unalias docker\n\n\nWe will apply the native microK8s commands by prefix commands microk8s.\nmicrok8s.docker ps\n\n\nContinue setup and configuration from the Kubernetes Dashboard section in the Mojaloop's deployment guide document.\n\n\n2. Useful Tips\n\nResolve problems with VSCode and kafka on ubuntu 18.04. To make the code work with VSCode debugger, added the following into the launch.json \"env\": {\n         \"LD_LIBRARY_PATH\": \"${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/node-rdkafka/build/deps\",\n         \"WITH_SASL\": 0\n       }\n\n\n\n"},"deployment-guide/local-setup-mac.html":{"url":"deployment-guide/local-setup-mac.html","title":"Local Setup Mac","keywords":"","body":"Mojaloop local environment setup for Mac\nLocal setup on a Laptop or Desktop to run the Mojaloop project.\nSetup Introduction\nThis document will provide guidelines to a technical capable resources to setup, deploy and configure the Mojaloop applications on a local environment, utilizing Docker, Kubernetes and HELM charts.\nAt this point the reader/implementer should be familiar with Mojaloop's deployment guide.

(At least 16GB will be required to run the Mojaloop project).\n\n\nInstalling Docker for Windows:\nYou will require Docker Desktop for Windows 18.02 Edge (win50) and higher, or 18.06 Stable (win 70) and higher. Kubernetes on Docker Desktop for Windows is available on these versions and higher. They are downloadable from:\nhttps://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/\nOnce download is completed, the downloaded file can normally be found in your Download folder. Installation is as per normal installations for windows. A restart will be required after this step.\n\nEnable visualization:  \nDocker Desktop for Windows requires Microsoft Hyper-V to run. The Docker Desktop installer enables Hyper-V for you.\nIf Hyper-V is not enabled, A pop-up messages will request if you would like to turn this on. Read the messages and select 'Ok' if appropriate.\nYou need to insure that VT-X/AMD-v is enabled from cmd.exe:\nsysteminfo\n\nIf not, from cmd.exe run as Administrator and execute:\nbcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype auto\n\nA reboot would be required again for the updates to take effect.\n\nStart Docker Desktop for Windows:\nDocker does not start automatically after installation. To start it, select Docker Desktop and click on it (or hit Enter).\nWhen the whale in the status bar stays steady, Docker Desktop is up-and-running, and accessible from any terminal window. Note - if the whale is not on the status bar, it will be in the hidden icon notifications area, click the up arrow on the taskbar to show it.\n  \n\n\n1.2 Kubernetes environment setup\n\nSetting up the Kubernetes runtime environment within Docker Desktop:\n\nOpen the Docker Desktop for Windows menu by right-clicking the Docker icon. \n\nSelect Settings to open the settings dialog. \nUnder the General tab you can configure when to start and update Docker. \n\n\nGo to Advanced tab\n\nIncrease the CPU allocation to at least 4\nIncrease the Memory allocation to at least 8.0 GiB\n\n\n\n(If your system resource allow, more can be allocated as indicated below.)\n  \nKubernetes on Docker Desktop for Windows is available in 18.02 Edge (win50) and higher, and in 18.06 Stable (win 70) and higher.\n\ngo to Kubernetes tab\nSelect Enable Kubernetes\nSelect Show system container (advanced)\n\n\n\n  \n\nSet the context to be used.\nAs mentioned, the Kubernetes client command, kubectl is included and configured to connect to the local Kubernetes server.

Known issues\n1.1. Mojaloop Helm Charts does not support Kubernetes v1.16 or greater\nDescription\nWhen installing mojaloop helm charts, the following error occurs:\n   Error: validation failed: [unable to recognize \"\": no matches for kind \"Deployment\" in version \"apps/v1beta2\", unable to recognize \"\": no matches for kind \"Deployment\" in version \"extensions/v1beta1\", unable to recognize \"\": no matches for kind \"StatefulSet\" in version \"apps/v1beta2\", unable to recognize \"\": no matches for kind \"StatefulSet\" in version \"apps/v1beta1\"]\nReason\nIn version 1.16 of Kubernetes breaking change has been introduced (more about it in \"Deprecations and Removals\" of Kubernetes release notes. The  Kubernetes API versions apps/v1beta1 and apps/v1beta2are no longer supported and  and have been replaced by apps/v1.\nCurrently Mojaloop helm charts (as of v8.4.x) refer to deprecated ids, therefore it's not possible to install current Mojaloop charts on Kubernetes version above 1.15 without manually changing charts.\nRefer to the following issue for more info: mojaloop/helm#219\nFixes\nEnsure that you are deploying the Mojaloop Helm charts on v1.15 of Kubernetes (or microk8s when working locally).\nAdditional details for microk8s fix\nTo check version of microk8s:\n   snap info microk8s\n\nNote: Look at the end of the output for a row starting with \"installed\"\nTo install most recent supported version:\n   snap refresh microk8s --channel=1.15/stable --classic\n\n2. Deployment issues\n2.1. MicroK8s - helm init connection refused\nDescription\nThe helm init:\n   helm init\n\nfails with error when installing locally on microk8s:\n   Error: error installing: Post http://localhost:8080/apis/apps/v1/namespaces/kube-system/deployments: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8080: connect: connection refused\nReason\nThis may be a missing  ~/.kube/config file, where helm looks for connection details.\nFix - option #1\nOne of the solutions is to generate that file by issuing:\n   microk8s.kubectl config view --raw > $HOME/.kube/config\n\nFix - option #2\nAnother option is to export the config to a new file:\n   microk8s.kubectl config view --raw > $HOME/.kube/local.config\n\nAnd then export the following env var:\n   export KUBECONFIG=$HOME/.kube/local.config\n\n2.2. ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED Error\nDescription\nThe following error is displayed when attempting to access an end-point (e.g. central-ledger.local) via the Kubernetes Service directly in a browser: ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED\nFixes\n\nVerify that that Mojaloop was deployed by checking that the helm chart(s) was installed by executing:\n  helm list\n\nIf the helm charts are not listed, see the Helm Chart Installation section to install a chart.\n\nEnsure that all the Mojaloop Pods/Containers have started up correctly and are available through the Kubernetes dashboard.\n\nNote that the Mojaloop deployment via Helm can take a few minutes to initially startup depending on the system's available resources and specification. It is recommended that you wait at least 10m for all Pods/Containers to self heal before troubleshooting.\n\n\n2.3. MicroK8s - Connectivity Issues\nDescription\nMy pods can’t reach the internet or each other (but my MicroK8s host machine can). \nAn example of this is that the Central-Ledger logs indicate that there is an error with the Broker transport as per the following example:\n2019-11-05T12:28:10.470Z - info: Server running at: \n2019-11-05T12:28:10.474Z - info: Handler Setup - Registering {\"type\":\"prepare\",\"enabled\":true}!\n2019-11-05T12:28:10.476Z - info: CreateHandler::connect - creating Consumer for topics: [topic-transfer-prepare]\n2019-11-05T12:28:10.515Z - info: CreateHandler::connect - successfully connected to topics: [topic-transfer-prepare]\n2019-11-05T12:30:20.960Z - error: Consumer::onError()[topics='topic-transfer-prepare'] - Error: Local: Broker transport failure)\nFixes\nMake sure packets to/from the pod network interface can be forwarded to/from the default interface on the host via the iptables tool. Such changes can be made persistent by installing the iptables-persistent package:\nsudo iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT\nsudo apt-get install iptables-persistent\n\nor, if using ufw:\nsudo ufw default allow routed\n\nThe MicroK8s inspect command can be used to check the firewall configuration:\nmicrok8s.inspect\n\n3.

You'll see issues there that are open and marked as bugs, stories, or epics. An epic is larger work that contains multiple stories. Start with any stories that are marked with \"good first issue\". In addition, anything that is in the backlog and not assigned to someone are things we could use help with. Stories that have owners are in someone's backlog already, though you can always ask about them in the issue or on Slack.\nThere's a roadmap that shows larger work that people could do or are working on. It has some main initiatives and epics and the order, but lacks dates as this work is community driven. Work is broken down from there into issues in GitHub.\nIn general, we are looking for example implementations and bug fixes, and project enhancements.\nWhere do I get help?\nJoin the Mojaloop Slack Discussions to connect with other developers.\nAlso checkout the FAQ\nWhat is the current release?\nSee the Mojaloop Slack Announcements to find out information on the latest release.\nWhat's here and what's not?\nThis is free code provided under an Apache 2.0 license.\nThe code is released with an Apache 2.0 license but the Specification documents under the 'mojaloop-specification' documents are published with CC BY-ND 4.0 License\nWe don't provide production servers to run it on. That's up to you. You are free (and encouraged!) to clone these repositories, participate in the community of developers, and contribute back to the code.\nWe are not trying to replace any mobile wallet or financial providers. We provide code to link together new and existing financial providers using a common scheme. There are central services for identifying a customer's provider, quoting, fulfillment, deferred net settlement, and shared fraud management. Each provider can take advantage of these services to send and receive money with others on the system and there's no cost to them to onboard new providers. We provide code for a simple example mobile money provider to show how integration can be done, but our example DFSP is not meant to be a production mobile money provider.\nWhere do I send bugs, questions, and feedback?\nFor bugs, see Reporting bugs.\nRelated Projects\nThe Interledger Protocol Suite (ILP) is an open and secure standard that enables DFSPs to settle payments with minimal counter-party risk (the risk you incur when someone else is holding your money). With ILP, you can transact across different systems with no chance that someone in the middle disappears with your money. Mojaloop uses the Interledger Protocol Suite for the clearing layer.\nTypes of Contributors\nThere are three types of contributors that we are targeting for this phase of the Mojaloop project.\nDevelopers or General Contributors\nThese individuals are those that want to start contributing to the Mojaloop community. This could be a developer or quality assurance person that wants to write new code or fix a bug. This could also be a business, compliance or risk specialist that wants to help provide rules, write documentation or participate in requirements gathering.\nHub Operators\nTypically these or organizations or individuals or government agencies that are interested in setting up their own Mojaloop Switch to become part of the ecosystem.\nImplementation Teams\nImplementation teams can assist banks, government offices, mobile operators or credit unions in deploying Mojaloop.\n"},"contributors-guide/standards/":{"url":"contributors-guide/standards/","title":"Standards","keywords":"","body":"Standards\nStandards\nStandards for adopting an Open Source contribution into Mojaloop\nThis document provides guidelines regarding the adoption of a contribution to the Mojaloop Open Source repositories.\nPrerequisites\n\nThe contribution should be in-line with the LevelOne Principles\nBasic guidelines regarding status of the contribution (Code-base / Standards / Designs / Specifications)\nBasic documentation to get started\n\nGuidelines regarding adoption\n\nCreate a private repo on the Mojaloop GitHub organization\nHave a sub-team of the DA take a look to make sure its portable (to OSS) - aligns with L1P principles, etc, and ensure design is in line with standards\nCheck Licensing\nAssess Performance impact\nCreate action items (stories) to update naming, remove/sanitize any items that are not generic\nConfiguration for 'modes of operation'\nEnable CI/CD pipeline\n\nVersioning\nReview the information on versioning for Mojaloop.\nCreating new Features\nProcess for creating new features and branches in Mojaloop.\nPull Request Process\nIt's a good idea to ask about major changes on Slack.

We also have included the recommendation links/versions for each of these tools.\nTOOL CHOICES\n\nAPI Development\nRAML and Swagger 2.0 is leveraged for API development.\nWSO2 offers an enterprise platform for integrating APIs, applications, and web services—locally and across the Internet. It also provides Mojaloop with a Security Layer, and Development Portal.\n\n\nCircle-CI - This tool is used for continuous build and continuous deployment. We needed an online continuous build and testing system that can work with many small projects and a distributed team. Jenkins was considered, but it requires hosting a server and a lot of configuration. CircleCI allowed for a no host solution that could be started with no cost and very limited configuration. We thought we might start with CircleCI and move off later if we outgrew it, but that hasn’t been needed.\nDactyl – We need to be able to print the online documentation. While it’s possible to print markdown files directly one at a time, we’d like to put the files into set of final PDF documents, where one page might end up in more than one final manual. Dactyl is a maintained open source conversion tool that converts between markdown and PDF. We originally tried Pandoc, but it had bugs with converting tables. Dactyl fixes that and is much more flexible.\nDBeaver - DBeaver is a free multi-platform database tool for developers, SQL programmers, database administrators and analysts. Supports all popular databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, SQLite, Oracle, DB2, SQL Server, Sybase, MS Access, Teradata, Firebird, Derby, etc.\nDocker - The Docker container engine creates and runs the Docker container from the Docker image file.\nDocker hub is used to link, build, test and push the Mojaloop code repositories. We needed to support both local and cloud execution. We have many small microservices that have very simple specific configurations and requirements. The easiest way to guarantee that the service works the same way in every environment from local development, to cloud, to hosted production is to put each microservice in a Docker container along with all the prerequisites it needs to run. The container becomes a secure, closed, pre-configured, runnable unit.\nDraw.io – We need to create pictures for our documents and architecture diagrams using an (ideally free) open source friendly tool, that is platform agnostic, supports vector and raster formats, allows WYSIWYG drawing, works with markdown, and is easy to use. We looked at many tools including: Visio, Mermaid, PlantUML, Sketchboard.io, LucidChart, Cacoo, Archi, and Google Drawings. Draw.io scored at the top for our needs. It’s free, maintained, easy to use, produces our formats, integrates with DropBox and GitHub, and platform agnostic. In order to save our diagrams, we have to save two copies – one in SVG (scalable vector) format and the other in PNG (raster). We use the PNG format within the docs since it can be viewed directly in GitHub. The SVG is used as the master copy as it is editable.\nESLint - Within JavaScript code, we use ESLint as a code style guide and style enforcement tool.\nGitHub – GitHub is a widely-used source code repository service, based on git, the standard source code version control system for open source projects. So the decision to use GitHub was straightforward. We create a story every time for integration work. Create bugs for any issues. Ensure all stories are tracked throughout the pipeline to ensure reliable metrics.\nHelm - The Helm package manager for Kubernetes provides templatized deployments and configurations and allow for overall complexity management.\nKafka - This technology is leveraged to support Mojaloop’s demand for a high velocity and high volume data messaging but keep our hardware requirements minimum.\nJavaScript - The Mojaloop application is primarily written in JavaScript.\nKubectl - This is a command line interface for running commands against Kubernetes clusters.\nKubernetes - This enterprise tool provides an extraction layer, infrastructure management and a container-orchestration system.\nMarkdown – Documentation is a deliverable for this project, just like the code, and so we want to treat it like the code in terms of versioning, review, check in, and tracking changes. We also want the documentation to be easily viewable online without constantly opening a viewer. GitHub has a built-in format called Markdown which solves this well. The same files work for the Wiki and the documents. They can be reviewed with the check in using the same tools and viewed directly in GitHub. We considered Google Docs, Word and PDF, but these binary formats aren’t easily diff-able. A disadvantage is that markdown only allows simple formatting – no complex tables or font changes - but this should be fine when our main purpose is clarity.\nMySQLWorkbench – MySQL Workbench is a unified visual tool for database architects, developers, and DBAs. MySQL Workbench provides data modeling, SQL development, and comprehensive administration tools for server configuration, user administration, backup, and much more. MySQL Workbench is available on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.\nNodeJS - This development tool is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that runs Mojaloop. NodeJS is designed to create simple microservices and it has a huge set of open source libraries available. Node performance is fine and while Node components don’t scale vertically a great deal, but we plan to scale horizontally, which it does fine. The original Interledger code was written in NodeJS as was the level one prototype. Most teams used Node already, so this made sense as a language. Within NodeJS code, we use Standard as a code style guide and to enforce code style.\nNPM - NPM is the package manager for Mojaloop since JavaScript is the default programming language.\nPercona for MySQL - These tools are leveraged as a relational database management system to ensure high performance and enterprise-grade functionality for the Mojaloop system. We needed a SQL backend that is open source friendly and can scale in a production environment. Thus, we chose MySQL, an open-source relational database management system.\nPostman is a Google Chrome application for interacting with HTTP APIs. It presents you with a friendly GUI for constructing requests and reading responses.\nRancher 2.0 - The Infrastructure management, provisioning and monitoring is provided by Rancher 2.0 which is an enterprise Kubernetes platform that manage Kubernetes deployments, clusters, on cloud & on-prem. Rancher makes it easy for DevOps teams to test, deploy and manage the Mojaloop system no matter where it is running.\nSlack – Slack is used for internal team communication. This was largely picked because several team already used it and liked it as a lightweight approach compared to email.\nSonarQube – We need an online dashboard of code quality (size, complexity, issues, and coverage) that can aggregate the code from all the repos. We looked at several online services (CodeCov, Coveralls, and Code Climate), but most couldn’t do complexity or even number of lines of code. Code Climate has limited complexity (through ESLint), but costs 6.67/seat/month. SonarQube is free, though it required us to setup and maintain our own server. It gave the P1 features we wanted.\nSourceTree – Sourcetree simplifies how you interact with your Git repositories so you can focus on coding. Visualize and manage your repositories through Sourcetree's simple Git GUI.\nStories On Board - We use Stories on Board to help capture our high level Epics at a portfolio level before they are commmitted and moved to Github. Our Story Board for Mojaloop is located here\nVisual Studio Code - Visual Studio Code is a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications. Visual Studio Code is free and available on your favorite platform - Linux, macOS, and Windows.\nZenHub – We needed a project management solution that was very light weight and cloud based to support distributed teams. It had to support epics, stories, and bugs and a basic project board. VS and Jira online offerings were both considered. For a small distributed development team an online service was better. For an open source project, we didn’t want ongoing maintenance costs of a server. Direct and strong GitHub integration was important. It was very useful to track work for each microservice with that microservice. Jira and VS both have more overhead than necessary for a project this size and don’t integrate as cleanly with GitHub as we’d want. ZenHub allowed us to start work immediately. A disadvantage is the lack of support for cumulative flow diagrams and support for tracking # of stories instead of points, so we do these manually with a spreadsheet updated daily and the results published to the \"Project Management\" Slack channel.\n\nTECHNOLOGY CHOICES\n\nAgile development - This methodology is used to track and run the project. The requirements need to be refined as the project is developed, therefore we picked agile development over waterfall or lean.\nAPIs - In order to avoid confusion from too many changing microservices, we use strongly defined APIs that conform to our Pragmatic REST design pattern. APIs will be defined using OpenAPI or RAML. Teams document their APIs with Swagger v2.0 or RAML v0.8 so they can automatically test, document, and share their work. Swagger is slightly preferred as there are free tools. Mule will make use of RAML 0.8. Swagger can be automatically converted to RAML v0.8, or manually to RAML v1.0 if additional readability is desired.\nAutomated Testing - For the most part, most testing will be automated to allow for easy regression. See the automated testing strategy and code quality metrics for standards.\nHosting - Mojaloop has been designed to be infrastructure agnostic and as such is supported by AWS, Azure and On-Premise installations.\nInterledger – Mojaloop needed a lightweight, open, and secure transport protocol for funds. Interledger.org provides all that. It also provides the ability to connect to other systems. We also considered block chain systems, but block chain systems send very large messages which will be harder to guarantee delivery of in third world infrastructure. Also, while blockchain systems provide good anonymity, that is not a project goal. To enable fraud detection, regulatory authorities need to be able to request records of transfers by account and person.\nOpen source - The entire project has been released as open source in accordance with the Level One Project principles. All tools and processes must be open source friendly and support projects that use an Apache 2.0 license with no restrictive licenses requirements on developers.\nOperating System – Microsoft Windows is widely used in many target countries, but we need an operating system that is free of license fees and is open source compatible. We are using Linux. We don’t have a dependency on the particular flavor, but are using the basic Amazon Linux. In the Docker containers, Alpine Linux is used.\nMicroservices - Because the architecture needs to easily deploy, scale, and have components be easily replaced or upgraded, it will be built as a set of microservices.\nScaled Agile Framework - There were four initial development teams that are geographically separate. To keep the initial phase of the project on track, the scaled agile framework (SAFe) was picked. This means work is divided into program increments (PI) that are typically four 2 week sprints long. As with the sprints, the PI has demo-able objective goals defined in each PI meeting.\nServices - Microservices are grouped and deployed in a few services such as the DFSP, Central Directory, etc. Each of these will have simple defined interfaces, configuration scripts, tests, and documentation.\nThreat Modeling, Resilience Modeling, and Health Modeling - Since the Mojaloop code needs to exchange money in an environment with very flaky infrastructure it must have good security, resilience, and easily report it's health state and automatically attempt to return to it. \nUSSD - Smart phones are only 25% of the target market and not currently supported by most money transfer service, so we need a protocol that will work on simple feature phones. Like M-Pesa, we are using USSD between the phone and the digital financial service provider (DFSP).\n\n"},"contributors-guide/tools-and-technologies/pragmatic-rest.html":{"url":"contributors-guide/tools-and-technologies/pragmatic-rest.html","title":"Pragmatic REST","keywords":"","body":"Pragmatic REST\nPragmatic REST For the Mojaloop Project\nWith the emergence of API strategy as a scaling tool for Internet service businesses, the focus on interconnect technology has shifted. Building on the principles that enabled the Web to form and scale, REST (Representational State Transfer) has become a design preference for Internet service APIs. But while the REST principles, proposed in Roy Fielding's dissertation that defined them, have academic value as a basis for research, a pure REST design is not at present practical for most applications. We are advocating a kind of Pragmatic REST-a design pattern that adopts the beneficial components of RESTful design without requiring strict adherence to academic purity.\nThe Richardson Maturity Model\nMartin Fowler has referenced1 a structured model of RESTful adoption developed by Leonard Richardson and explained at a QCon talk. Fowler refers to this as the Richardson Maturity Model of RESTful design.\n\nMartin Fowler, referencing Rest in Practice,2 summarizes the genesis of RESTful design:\n\nuse Restful web services to handle many of the integration problems that enterprises face. At its heart . . . is the notion that the web is an existence proof of a massively scalable distributed system that works really well, and we can take ideas from that to build integrated systems more easily.\n\nA pragmatic approach to RESTful design uses the best parts of Fielding's conceptual framework to allow developers and integrators to understand what they can do with the API as rapidly as possible and without writing extraneous code.\nAt its most fundamental, a RESTful design is resource-centric and uses HTTP verbs. At its most advanced, a design that follows pure academic REST utilizes the HATEOAS principle by implementing Hypermedia Controls. We are advocating a Level 2 RESTful design for Mojaloop.\nWhy not Hypermedia Controls?\nAlthough HATEOAS is a fascinating principle-it advocates that a server should respond to each client action with a list of all possible actions that can lead the client to its next application state. And further, clients must not rely on out of band information (like a written API spec) for what actions can be performed on which resources or on the format of URIs.\nIt is this final proscription that fails the test of Pragmatic REST: While HATEOAS is an interesting theoretical approach to limit coupling, it does not easily apply to Mojaloop (or any other contract API design). When we take into account our audience for the interconnect APIs, we find a group of commercial entities that will be operating under a set of highly specific scheme rules. Interactions between the participants, and between participant and central service hub, will be highly specified to assign acceptable commercial risk that can be priced at very low cost to end-users. This requires ex-ante predictability of the API which is anathema to the HATEOAS principle defined by Fielding.\nPragmatic RESTful Principles\nURIs Define Resources\nA well-designed URI pattern makes an API easy to consume, discover, and extend, just as a carefully designed API does in a traditional programming language. Pure REST disdains this principle in favor of HATEOAS. But pragmatic REST follows a normal pattern for URI definitions to improve human understanding, even if HATEOAS principles are employed for discovery.\nURI paths that refer to a collection of objects should consist of a plural noun, e.g. /customers, to refer to a set of customers. When a collection can have only one instance, the singular noun should be used to avoid confusion. E.g. GET /transfers/:id/fulfillment is correct, since there is only one fulfillment object per identified transfer.\nURI paths that refer to a single object should consist of a plural noun (representing the collection), followed by a predefined unique identifier. E.g., /customers/123456 to refer to the specific customer with number 123456. The identifier must be unique within the containing collection and persist for the life of the object within that collection. IDs must not be ordinal values-ordinal retrieval of objects from a collection is possible using query parameters on the collection URI.\nURI paths may have a prefix to identify the environment, version, or other context of the resource. Nothing should follow the identifying path but collections and object references.\nURI path and query segment identifiers should be chosen from the Roman character set, [0-9A-Za-z]. Use camelCase to define the elements of the URI path. Do not use snake_case.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, \"_\" (underscore) and \"-\" (hyphen) should not be used in URI path or query segment identifiers.\nThis probably seems a bit parochial. The purpose is to find a well-defined URI format that is consistent with wide-spread practice, easy to define, predictable, and that maps to native environments and conventions. It isn't going to satisfy everyone. Here is reasoning behind this constraint:\nCapitalCase and camelCase are the defacto standard for NodeJS and JavaScript and are a common constraint in URI definition: URI path segments are often mapped to JS internal resources and so conforming to JS naming conventions makes sense.\nField names in JSON and SQL should also follow this convention since they are often automatically mapped into variable name space and can be referenced in URIs as path or query segment identifiers.\nWe should also avoid the use of \"$\" unless it is required by a library (e.g. JQuery). IBM JCL has passed away; let it rest in peace. There are better scope control tools to separate name spaces than introducing non-roman symbols.\nWe should avoid \"-\" (hyphen) in path segment and query parameter names as it does not map into variable names, SQL, or JSON field name identifiers.\nUnderscore characters must be escaped in markdown source by prefixing each with a \"\\\" character.\nSnake_case has been reported to be slightly easier to read than camelCase in variable names, but it actually does not improve readability of URIs, as it visually interferes with path and query segment delimiters making it difficult to visually parse them. And when URIs are underlined in presentation, the underscores become illegible.\nURI Parameters\nUse a standard and predictable set of optional parameters in a consistent way.\nA set of standard query parameters should be used for collections to enable caller control over how much of the collection they see. E.g. \"count\" to determine how many objects to return, \"start\" to determine where to start counting in the result set, and \"q\" as a generic free-form search query. We will define the standard set of parameters as we go and will apply them consistently.\nVerbs\nSingular objects should support GET for read, PUT for complete replacement (or creation when the primary key is specified by the client and is persistent, e.g. a payment card PAN), and DELETE for delete.\nCollections should support GET to read back the whole or part of a collection, and POST to add a new object to the collection.\nSingular objects may support POST as a way to change their state in specified ways. Posting a JSON document to a singular object URI may allow selected field values to be updated or trigger a state change or action without replacing the whole object.\nGET must be implemented in a nullipotent manner-that is, GET never causes side effects and never modifies client-visible system state (other than logging events or updating instrumentation, e.g.).\nPUT and DELETE must be implemented in an idempotent manner-that is, changes are applied consistently to the system data in a way that is dependent only on the state of the resource and inputs but on nothing else. The action has no additional effect if it is executed more than once with the same input parameters and does not depend on the order of other operations on a containing collection or other resources held in the collection. For example, removing a resource from a collection can be considered an idempotent operation on the collection. Using PUT to fully replace (or create) a uniquely identified resource when the URI is fully known to the client is also idempotent. This implies that the system may reorder operations to improve efficiency, and the client does not need to know whether a resource exists before attempting to replace it.\nPOST and PATCH3 are not idempotent operations. POST is used to create new resources where the resource identifier is assigned by the server or where a single identified internal resource is implied by the target URI (e.g. POST /transfers, but PUT /transfers/:id/fulfillment).\nData Format\nWe favor JSON4 related data formats over XML. In some cases, data formats will be binary or XML, as defined by pre-existing standards, and these will be precisely specified. Binary formats should have a formal syntax to avoid ambiguous representational translations (e.g. character set translations, big- or little-endian representations of numeric values, etc).\nDate and time values used in APIs should comply to the ISO 8601 standard, and further profiled by the w3c Note on Date and Time Formats.5 This w3c note should lead to the reduction in complexity and error scope of communicating components that must exchange tangible dates and times. There will be cases where we use non-ISO format date or time as required by an external standard, e.g. ISO 7813 expiry dates.\nExisting standard XML formats should have an XSD schema for the acceptable subset profile used within the project. For particularly complex data formats, we may use a common format profile translator to map between our project subset of the standard format and the wire format used by a standardized protocol (e.g.). This will limit coupling to complex formats in a more maintainable way.\nWhen specifying the PATCH action for a resource, we will use a consistent patch document format (e.g. JSON Patch6).\nReturn Codes\nUse HTTP return codes in a consistent way and according to their standard definitions. The standard codes are defined in RFC 2616.7\nMachine Readable Error Format\nThe API should provide a machine readable error result in a well-defined JSON format. {TBD whether to use a response envelope and how to format errors, faults, and success envelopes. RESTful design relies on headers to carry protocol-defined errors, debug info can also be carried in headers. We should be clear on why we are using an envelope and how this supports normal production communication between client and server.\nVersioning\nAPI URIs should include a version identifier in the format vM as a leading path element (where \"M\" is the Major component of the multi-part version number). The API and its version identifier element must conform to the semantic versioning8 2.0 specification for API versioning.\nA client must specify the Major version number in each request. It is not possible for a client to express a requirement for a specific minor version.\nThe full API version number is specified in the response header (TBD) for all successful and error responses.\nWhile an API version contract will be influenced by Major, minor, and patch levels, only the Major version number is a production API binding element-that is, a production client cannot request a particular minor version or patch level and a production server will not accept a URI request that specifies these extra elements.\nHowever, in pre-production environments, it is anticipated that some combination of minor, patch, pre-release, and metadata suffixes would be supported in client requests (as defined in semver [3]) and may be expressed in pre-production URIs to assist with development and integration scenarios.\nWe May Need to Give REST a Rest\nAs we design the interconnection APIs between components and between participating systems, we may find API requirements that don't precisely match the Pragmatic REST pattern defined here. We will evaluate these case-by-case and make the best choice to support the project goals.\nNon-Functional Requirements\nAs we develop the APIs, we will make consistent choices about non-functional requirements to reinforce the project goals.\n1: http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html, retrieved August 18, 2016.\n2: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596805829, retrieved August 18, 2016.\n3: RFC 5789, PATCH Method for HTTP, https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789, retrieved August 18, 2016.\n4: Introducing JSON, http://json.org/, retrieved August 18, 2016.\n5: http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/NOTE-datetime-19980827, retrieved August 22, 2016.\n6: JSON Patch, http://jsonpatch.com/, retrieved August 18, 2016.\n7: https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html\n8: Semantic Versioning 2.0.0, http://semver.org/, retrieved August 18, 2016.\n"},"contributors-guide/tools-and-technologies/code-quality-metrics.html":{"url":"contributors-guide/tools-and-technologies/code-quality-metrics.html","title":"Code Quality Metrics","keywords":"","body":"Code Quality Metrics\nFunctional quality metrics\nUnit test metrics\nHigh coverage and low dependencies show that the code is testable and therefore well isolated and easy to maintain.

Also, the tests are automatically executed every time a check-in is done and a Github Pull-Request issued for the code to be integrated into the project.\nThe procedure described above, falls outside the realm of Quality Assurance (QA) and Regression testing, which this document addresses.\nOnce a developer has written new functionality or extended existing functionality, by having to go through the above rigorous tests, one can assume the functionality in question is executing as intended. How does one then ensure that this new portion of code does not negatively affect the project or product as a whole?\nWhen the code has passed all of the above and is deployed as part of the CI/CD processes implemented by our workflow, the new component(s) are accepted onto the various hosts, cloud-based or on-premise implementations. These hosts ranges from development platforms through to production environments.\n\n\nPostman and Newman Testing\n Parallel to the deployment process is the upkeep and maintenance of the Postman Collection testing Framework. When a new release is done, as part of the workflow, Release Notes are published listing all of the new and/or enhanced functionality implemented as part of the release. These notes are used by the QA team to extend and enhance the existing Postman Collections where tests are written behind the request/response scripts to test both positive as well as negative scenarios agains the intended behaviour. These tests are then run in the following manner:\n\nManually to determine if the tests cover all aspects and angles of the functionality, positive to assert intended behaviour and negative tests to determine if the correct alternate flows work as intended when something unexpected goes wrong\nScheduled - as part of the Regression regime, to do exactly the same as the manual intent, but fully automated (with the Newman Package) with reports and logs produced to highlight any unintended behaviour and to also warn where known behaviour changed from a previous run.\n\nIn order to facilitate the automated and scheduled testing of a Postman Collection, there are various methods one can follow and the one implemented for Mojaloop use is explained further down in this document.\nThere is a complete repository containing all of the scripts, setup procedures and anything required in order to set up an automated QA and Regression Testing Framework. This framework allows one to target any Postman Collection, specifying your intended Environment to execute against, as well as a comma-separated list of intended email recipients to receive the generated report. This framework is in daily use by Mojaloop and exists on an EC2 instance on AWS, hosting the required components like Node, Docker, Email Server and Newman, as well as various Bash Scripts and Templates for use by the framework to automatically run the intended collections every day. Using this guide will allow anyone to set up their own Framework.\nPostman Collections\nThere are a number of Postman collections in use throughout the different processes:\n\nOSS-New-Deployment-FSP-Setup : This collection needs to be executed once after a new deployment, normally by the Release Manager, to seed the Database with the required enumerations and static data, as well as test FSPs with their accounts and position data in order to be able to execute any manual or automation tests by other collections.\nNotes: Ensure that there is a delay of 200ms if executed through Postman UI Test Runner. This will ensure that tests have enough time to validate requests against the simulator. \n\n\nOSS-API-Tests : This suite of tests will issue a request/response against each and every exposed API, testing APIs such as the Mojaloop core APIs, bulk quotes, admin-APIs, Settlement APIs, Metrics APIs, Fund-in and out APIs etc. These tests are done to test the message headers, body, responses received and not to test the end-to-end flow of a transfer for example\nNotes: Ensure that there is a delay of 1500ms if executed through Postman UI Test Runner. This will ensure that tests have enough time to validate requests against the simulator.\n\n\nOSS-Feature-Tests : Scenario based testing are performed with this collection, such as Settlements processes, Block Transfers, Negative testing scenarios and so on\nNotes: Ensure that there is a delay of 1500ms if executed through Postman UI Test Runner. This will ensure that tests have enough time to validate requests against the simulator.\n\n\nGolden_Path : This test collection is the one used by the scheduled regression testing framework to test end-to-end scenarios, resembling real-world use-cases where the response from one API call is used to populate the request of a subsequent call. We make use of an intelligent simulator playing the role of an FSP on the recipient side of the scenario, responding to various request from a Payer FSP as an example\nNotes: Ensure that there is a delay of 1500ms if executed through Postman UI Test Runner. This will ensure that tests have enough time to validate requests against the simulator.\n\n\n\nEnvironment Configuration\nYou will need to customize the following environment config file to match your deployment environment:\n\nLocal Environment Config\n\nTips: \n\nThe host configurations will be the most likely changes required to match your environment. e.g. HOST_CENTRAL_LEDGER: http://central-ledger.local\nRefer to the ingress hosts that have been configured in your values.yaml as part of your Helm deployment.\n\nExecuting regression test\nFor the Mojaloop QA and Regression Testing Framework specifically, Postman regression test can be executed by going into the EC2 instance via SSH, for which you need the PEM file, and then by running a script(s).\nFollowing the requirements and instructions as set out in the detail in QA and Regression Testing Framework, everyone will be able to create their own Framework and gain access to their instance to execute tests against any Postman Collection targeting any Environment they have control over.\nSteps to execute the script via Postman UI\n\nImport the desired collection into your Postman UI. You can either download the collection from the repo or alternatively use the RAW link and import it directly via the import link option.\nImport the environment config into your Postman UI via the Environmental Config setup. Note that you will need to download the environmental config to your machine and customize it to your environment.\nEnsure that you have pre-loaded all prerequisite test data before executing transactions (party, quotes, transfers) as per the example collection OSS-New-Deployment-FSP-Setup:\nHub Accounts\nFSP onboarding\nAdd any test data to Simulator (if applicable)\nOracle onboarding\n\n\nThe p2p_money_transfer test cases from the Golden_Path collection are a good place to start.\n\nSteps to execute the bash script to run the Newman / Postman test via CLI\n\nTo run a test via this method, you will have to be in posession of the PEM-file of the server on which the Mojaloop QA and Regression Framework was deployed on an EC2 instance on Amazon Cloud.\n\nSSH into the specific EC2 instance and when running the script, it will in turn run the commands via an instantiated Docker container.\n\nYou will notice that by using this approach where both the URLs for the Postman-Collection and Environment File are required as input parameters (together with a comma-delimited email recipient list for the report) you have total freedom of executing any Postman Collection you choose.\n\nAlso, by having an Environment File, the specific Mojaloop services targeted can be on any server. This means you can execute any Postman test against any Mojaloop installation on any server of your choice.\n\nThe EC2 instance we execute these tests from are merely containing all the tools and processes in order to execute your required test and does not host any Mojaloop Services as such.\n\n\n./testMojaloop.sh   \nProcess flow of a typical Scheduled Test\n\nNewman Commands\nThe following section is a reference, obtained from the Newman Package site itself, highlighting the different commands that may be used in order to have access to the Postman environment by specifying some commands via the CLI.\nExample:\n+ newman run  -e  -n 1 --\n\nUsage: run  [options]\n\n  URL or path to a Postman Collection.\n\n    Options:\n\n    -e, --environment         Specify a URL or Path to a Postman Environment.\n    -g, --globals             Specify a URL or Path to a file containing Postman Globals.\n    --folder                  Specify folder to run from a collection.

The following are foundation-specific guidelines which have been updated and slightly modified.\nAcronyms\nSpell out all acronyms on first reference. Include the acronym in parentheses immediately after the full spelling only if you refer to it again in the document. Example: Kofi Annan, chairman of the board of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), traveled to Nairobi this month. It was his first visit to the AGRA office.\nAmpersand\nOnly use an ampersand (&) when it's part of a formal name like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In all other cases, spell out and.\nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation\nOur formal legal name is the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Use it on first reference. Always use the ampersand (&) and always capitalize Foundation when Bill & Melinda Gates comes before it.\nNever abbreviate the foundation's name as BMGF.\nNever translate the foundation name into other languages, as it is a proper noun. The one exception to this is when translating the foundation's name into Chinese, in which case translation is acceptable.\nDo not capitalize foundation when the word stands alone. Example: The foundation's new headquarters will be built near Seattle Center.\nUse Gates Foundation only if you are sure the context makes the foundation's identity clear. There is a Gates Family Foundation in Colorado, so we need to be careful. Example: The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Ford Foundation co-sponsored the event. A Gates Foundation staff member gave closing remarks.\nThe entity that manages the endowment is formally and legally known as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust. You will not need to refer to this entity often, but when you do, write it out on first reference and refer to it as the asset trust thereafter.\nBold and colons\nFrequently I see structures (like in this very comment!) where you have introductory terms or phrases that are bolded and set apart from the contents with a colon. Should the colon also be bolded, or not? (I frequently see it done both ways.)\nBuffett\nNote the spelling: two fs and two ts (i.e., Warren Buffett).\nBulleted lists\nIntroduce bulleted lists with a colon when the listed items complete the lead-in sentence or phrase. Exception: never use colons in headings or subheadings to introduce bulleted lists.\nCapitalize the first words of and use periods with listed items only if they are full sentences. Examples:\n\nThis is a complete sentence.\nnot a complete sentence\n\nNever link items in a bulleted list with coordinating conjunctions and punctuation (semicolons or commas) as you would in a sentence-style list. In other words, never do:\n\nthis,\nthat, or\nthe other thing.\n\nCaptions\nCaption photos whenever possible. It helps people understand our work.\nWrite captions as single gerund (ing verb) phrases, followed by the city, state or country, and year the photo was taken in parentheses. Example: A doctor preparing a vaccine for delivery (Brazzaville, Congo, 2007)._\nWhen writing a caption, be sure to introduce the people featured and explain what's happening in the image as it relates to our areas of focus. Be as brief as possible so you don't distract from the image or layout. Avoid verbs that state the obvious about what the photo's subject is doing (e.g., smiling, standing, and so on).\nIf one of the co-chairs appears in a photo with other people, be sure to identify the co-chair in the caption. Don't assume everyone knows what our co-chairs look like.\nCitations\nMost fields have their own citation conventions. Adopt those used by the field in question. When citation conventions are unavailable or uncertain, follow The Chicago Manual of Style.\nWhen a document uses both footnotes and endnotes, for the footnotes, use the following symbols:\n\n1st note = * (asterisk)\n2nd note = † (dagger)\n3rd note = ‡ (double dagger)\n4th note = § (section sign)\n5th note = ** (2 asterisks)\n6th note = †† (2 daggers)\n7th note = ‡‡ (2 double daggers)\n8th note = §§ (2 section signs) \n\nSeparate multiple superscript references (footnotes, endnotes) with commas, not semicolons.\nClinical trials\nUse Roman numerals when referring to clinical trial phases and always capitalize Phase. Example: The company will begin Phase III trials on the new drug this spring.\nContact information\nUse periods to separate parts of phone numbers, and begin each number with a plus sign.\nBecause we work with people throughout the world, omit the international access code, which differs from country to country (it's 011 in the United States). Examples: +1.206.709.3100 (United States) +91.11.4100.3100 (India)\nCopyright and trademark notice\nAll publications, media, and materials produced by or for the foundation should contain the notice shown below. The Legal team must approve all exceptions.\n © (year) Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. All Rights Reserved. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is a registered trademark in the United States and other countries.\nWhen possible, begin the trademark portion of the notice on a separate line.\nDashes\nUse dashes—those the width of a capital M—to indicate asides or abrupt changes in thought. Use en dashes—those the width of a capital N—with numerical ranges.\nDo not include a space before or after a dash.\nExamples: We work to make safe, affordable financial services—particularly savings accounts—more widely available to people in developing countries.\nIn the 2004 presidential election, 76 percent of U.S. college graduates ages 25-44 voted.\nDollars ($)\nIn Global Health and Global Development materials, because more than a dozen countries use dollars, specify U.S. dollars in parentheses on first mention in a document. Example: $100,000 (U.S.). Omit the parenthetical U.S. in subsequent references to dollar amounts in the same document.\nFoundation program names\nWe have three programs: Global Development Program, Global Health Program, and United States Program.\nProgram is capitalized when used with the full name (Global Development Program), but not when used alone (The program makes grants in several areas.).\nUse periods when abbreviating the name of the United States Program: U.S. Program.\nGH, GD, and USP are fine for internal use, but inappropriate for external publications.\nGates family\nWilliam Gates III is formally referred to as Bill Gates. In internal documents, use Bill—not a nickname or abbreviation.\nUse Melinda Gates when formally referring to Melinda.\nUse William H. Gates Sr. when formally referring to Bill Gates Sr. There is no comma between Gates and Sr. Bill Sr. is acceptable in internal documents.\nPlural: Gateses. Do not use an apostrophe to form the plural of the family's name. Example: The Gateses attended the opening of the new University of Washington law building.\nPossessive: The apostrophe follows Gates when you refer to something owned by either Bill or Melinda. Example: Melinda Gates' speech was well received. The apostrophe follows Gateses when you refer to something Bill and Melinda own jointly. Example: The Gateses' decision to provide free Internet access in U.S. public libraries has increased library usage and circulation overall.\nYou may also phrase it this way: Bill and Melinda Gates' decision to provide free Internet access …\nSee the Titles of people entry for the formal titles of Bill, Melinda, Bill Sr., and other leaders of the foundation.\nHyphens\nThere are few hard-and-fast rules when it comes to hyphens. Generally we use them to enhance the reader's understanding.\nExamples: When writing for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, use real-world poverty examples to illustrate your point. When writing for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, use real world-poverty examples to illustrate your point.\nIn the first example, the hyphen in real-world connects real and world to form a single adjective describing poverty. In the second example, the hyphen in world-poverty connects world and poverty to form a single adjective describing examples.\nThe meaning changes depending on the placement of the hyphen. In instances where a series of adjectives creates ambiguity about what they refer to, use a hyphen to clarify the intended meaning.\nWhen capitalizing hyphenated words, only capitalize the first part. Example: Co-chairs Bill and Melinda Gates.\nFor other uses of hyphens—compound modifiers, prefixes and suffixes, fractions—refer to the Associated Press Stylebook.\nNumerals\nWhen referring to dollar figures, spell out million and billion. Use figures and decimals (not fractions). Do not go beyond two decimal places. Example: The foundation granted .45 million to United Way.\nWhen using numbers that have nothing to do with dollar figures or percentages, write them out if they are under 10, and use numerals if they are 10 or over. Example: Four program officers went on 13 site visits.\nIn cases of grammatical parallelism, parallel construction always trumps this rule. For instance: Mr. Johnson has two children, 5-year-old Kyle and 13-year-old Frances.\nNever begin a sentence with a numeral. Either spell the number out or revise the sentence so it doesn't begin with a number.\nPercentages\nWhen using percentages, write out percent (don't use %). Use numerals instead of writing numbers out, even if they're less than 10.\nExample: This program accounts for 6 percent of our grantmaking.\nPhotographer credits\nIf the foundation owns the image you are using, you don't need to credit the photographer. All images in our media asset management system are foundation-owned. If the foundation has purchased a license to use the image, you may need to credit the photographer. If you have questions about photo credit requirements, contact the Foundation Communications Service Desk.\nPlain language\nWe could call out a few specific constructions that are needlessly wordy. One that we frequently catch at Ripple is \"in order to\" instead of just \"to.\"\nQuotation marks\nUse double quotation marks for dialogue and the citation of printed sources. Limit use of scare quotes—quotation marks meant to call attention to a quoted word or phrase and distance the author from its meaning, typically because the language is specialized, idiomatic, ironic, or misused. Example: The foundation has increasingly used “program-related investments” in recent years.\nQuoted strings and punctuation\nWhen describing exact strings in technical documentation, should punctuation (not part of the literal strings) be included in the quotation marks? For example, valid states include \"pending,\" \"in progress,\" and \"completed.\"\nScientific names\nCapitalize and italicize scientific names in accordance with conventions in the scientific community. Use the full version of a scientific name on first mention and the abbreviated form thereafter. For example, use Salmonella typhi first and S. typhi for each additional reference.\nSerial commas\nWith lists of three or more items in a sentence, add a final comma before the coordinating conjunction and or or. Example: The foundation's three program areas are Global Development, Global Health, and the United States.\nSpacing after punctuation\nUse only one space after punctuation, including periods, colons, and semicolons.\nSpelling and capitalization conventions\nbed net: two words, no hyphen.\nemail: one word, no hyphen, lowercase.\nfoundation: lowercase, except as part of the full foundation name.\ngrantmaking: one word, no hyphen.\nnongovernmental: one word, no hyphen.\nnonprofit: one word, no hyphen.\npostsecondary: one word, no hyphen.\nWashington state: lowercase state (unless you're referring to Washington State University, the Washington State Legislature, or something similar).\nwebsite: one word, lowercase\nTitles of people\nFormal titles should not be capitalized unless the title precedes a person's name or appears in a headline. Example: Co-chair Melinda Gates will speak at the Washington Economic Club this year.\nLowercase and spell out titles when they are not used with an individual's name. Example: The foundation co-chair issued a statement.\nLowercase and spell out titles in constructions that use commas to set them off from a name. Example: Bill Gates, co-chair of the foundation, commented on the grant.\nUnited States\nSpell out United States when using it as a noun. Abbreviate it as U.S. (including periods) when using it as an adjective. In certain cases, as when referring to a person from the United States, it's acceptable to use American.\nExamples: The U.S. State Department is in the United States. The foundation's U.S. Program…\nURL\nReference web addresses without the http:// as follows: www.gatesfoundation.org\n"},"mojaloop-technical-overview/":{"url":"mojaloop-technical-overview/","title":"Mojaloop Technical Overview","keywords":"","body":"Mojaloop Technical Overview\nMojaloop Services\nThe basic idea behind Mojaloop is that we need to connect multiple Digital Financial Services Providers (DFSPs) together into a competitive and interoperable network in order to maximize opportunities for poor people to get access to financial services with low or no fees. We don't want a single monopoly power in control of all payments in a country, or a system that shuts out new players. It also doesn't help if there are too many isolated subnetworks. The following diagrams shows the Mojaloop interconnects between DFSPs and the Mojaloop Hub (schema implementation example) for a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Transfer:\nMojaloop addresses these issues in several key ways:\n\nA set of central services provides a hub through which money can flow from one DFSP to another. This is similar to how money moves through a central bank or clearing house in developed countries. Besides a central ledger, central services can provide identity lookup, fraud management, and enforce scheme rules.\nA standard set of interfaces a DFSP can implement to connect to the system, and example code that shows how to use the system. A DFSP that wants to connect up can adapt our example code or implement the standard interfaces into their own software.

A DFSP that wants to connect up can adapt our example code or implement the standard interfaces into their own software. The goal is for it to be as straightforward as possible for a DFSP to connect to the interoperable network.\nThe Central Services (CS) provide the set of components required to move money from one DFSP to another through the Mojaloop API Adapters. This is similar to how money moves through a central bank or clearing house in developed countries. The Central Services contains the core Central Ledger logic to move money but also will be extended to provide fraud management and enforce scheme rules.\nThe Account Lookup Service (ALS) provides mechanism to resolve FSP routing information through the Particpant API or orchestrate a Party request based on an internal Participant look-up. The internal Participant look-up is handled by a number of standard Oracle adapter or services. Example Oracle adapter/service would be to look-up Participant information from Pathfinder or a Merchant Registry. These Oracle adapter or services can easily be added depending on the schema requirements.\nThe Quoting Service (QA) provides Quoting is the process that determines any fees and any commission required to perform a financial transaction between two FSPs. It is always initiated by the Payer FSP to the Payee FSP, which means that the quote flows in the same way as a financial transaction.\nThe Simulator (SIM) mocks several DFSP functions as follows:\nOracle end-points for Oracle Participant CRUD operations using in-memory cache;\nParticipant end-points for Oracles with support for parameterized partyIdTypes;\nParties end-points for Payer and Payee FSPs with associated callback responses;\nTransfer end-points for Payer and Payee FSPs with associated callback responses; and\nQuery APIs to verify transactions (requests, responses, callbacks, etc) to support QA testing and verification.\n\n\n\nOn either side of the Mojaloop Hub there is sample open source code to show how a DFSP can send and receive payments and the client that an existing DFSP could host to connect to the network.\n"},"mojaloop-technical-overview/overview/components-PI5.html":{"url":"mojaloop-technical-overview/overview/components-PI5.html","title":"Legacy Architecture - PI5","keywords":"","body":"Mojaloop Hub Legacy Components - PI5\nThe following component diagram shows the break-down of the Mojaloop services and its micro-service architecture for pre PI5: \n\nNote: Colour-grading indicates the relationship between data-store, and message-streaming / adapter-interconnects.

Design Considerations\n1.1. Account Lookup Service (ALS)\nThe ALS design provides a generic Central-Service component as part of the core Mojaloop. The purpose of this component is to provide routing and alignment to the Mojaloop API Specification. This component will support multiple Look-up registries (Oracles). This ALS will provide an Admin API to configure routing/config for each of the Oracles similiar to the Central-Service API for the End-point configuration for DFSP routing by the Notification-Handler (ML-API-Adapter Component). The ALS will in all intense purpose be a switch with a persistence store for the storage/management of the routing rules/config.\n1.1.1. Assumptions\n\nThe ALS design will only cater for a single switch for the time being.\nSupport for multiple switches will utilise the same DNS resolution mechanism that is being developed for the Cross Border/Network design.\n\n1.1.2. Routing\nThe routing configuration will be based on the following:\n\nPartyIdType - See section 7.5.6 of the Mojaloop Specification\nCurrency - See section 7.5.5 of the Mojaloop Specification. Currency code defined in ISO 4217 as three-letter alphabetic string. This will be optional, however isDefault indicator must be set to true if the Currency is not provided.\nisDefault - Indicator that a specific Oracle is the default provider for a specific PartyIdType. Note that there can be many default Oracles, but there can only be a single Oracle default for a specific PartyIdType. The default Oracle for a specific PartyIdType will only be selected if the originating request does not include a Currency filter.\n\n1.2. ALS Oracle\nThe ALS Oracle be implemented as either a Service or Adapter (semantic dependant on use - Mediation = Adapter, Service = Implementation) will provide a look-up registry component with similar functionality of the /participants Mojaloop API resources. It has however loosely based on the ML API specification as it's interface implements a sync pattern which reduces the correlation/persistence requirements of the Async Callback pattern implemented directly by the ML API Spec.

For details (refer to section 6.10) as per the Mojaloop Specification\n\nIntroduction\nDesign Considerations\nSteps involved in the high-level Architecture\nNotes\nDiscussion items\nProposed new tables\nBulk Transfers States\nAdditional Notes\n\n\nRoadmap Topics\n\n1. Introduction\nThe Bulk Transfers process is discussed in section 6.10 of the API Definition 1.0 document, depicted in Figure 60, of which a snapshot is posted below.\n\nThe key items implied in the specification in its current version 1.0 are that\n\nReservation of funds is done for each individual transfer from the Payer FSP to the Payee FSP\nEven if a single individual transfer fails during the prepare process, the whole bulk is to be rejected.\n\n2. Design Considerations\nAccording to the Figure-60 of the specification, below are a few key implications from the Specification.\n\nThe Payer DFSP performs user look-ups for the individual parties involved in the bulk payment separately\nThe Payer DFSP performs bulk quoting per Payee DFSP\nThe onus is on the Payer DFSP to prepare bulk transfers based on Payee FSPs and send out a bulk transfer request to a single Payee FSP\nThis seems to be an all-or-nothing process where even if a single individual transfer fails to be reserved, then the whole bulk needs to be rejected because it cannot be sent to the Payee as it is if it has an individual transfer for which funds couldn't be reserved.\nIn light of the above, the proposal being made right now is to empower the Switch (needs updating the Specification) to send out the POST /bulkTransfers request with the list of individual transfers for which funds were able to be reserved on the Switch.\nThe implication is that the Switch aggregates commits/failures from the Payee FSP for the bulk and sends out a single PUT /bulkTransfers/{ID} call to the Payer FSP that includes the entire list of transfers that includes individual transfers that failed both at the Switch and the Payee FSP\nFor example: If there are 1000 individual transfers in a Bulk Transfer and if the Switch is able to reserve funds for 900 of the individual transfers, then a prepare bulk transfer request to the Payee DFSP is sent with the list of those 900 individual transfers. Once the Payee FSP sends the Bulk Fulfil request for those 900 transfers of which lets say, 800 can be committed and 100 are aborted, then the Switch processes those individual transfers accordingly and sends out the PUT callback (PUT /bulkTransfers/{ID}) notification to the Payer FSP with all the 1000 individual transfers, 800 of which are committed and 200 of which are aborted.\nThere will be implications to aspects such as Signature, Encryption, PKI and other security aspects that will need to be addressed.\nThe ordering of the individual transfers need to be considered as well by the Scheme. A Goal for implementation in emerging markets is to maximize the number of transactions involved and so a well designed Scheme may re-order individual transfers in the ascending order of the magnitude of amounts and then process them. But this can be a Scheme consideration.\nHowever, a recommended Scheme Rule is that the Payee FSPs shouldn't be allowed to re-order the individual transfers in a bulk to avoid bias towards Payee parties.\nFor Settlements with bulk transfers where Government payments are involved with large sums of money needs to be discussed to allow for moving through transfers without strict liquidity rules needs to be discussed.\n\n3. Steps involved in the high-level Architecture\nBelow are the steps involved at a high level for bulk transfers.\n  \n\n[1.0, 1.1, 1.2] An Incoming bulk Transfer request (POST /bulkTransfers) on the bulk-api-adapter is placed in an object store and a notification with a reference to the actual message is sent via a kafka topic “bulk-prepare” and a 202 is sent to the Payer FSP  \n[1.3] Bulk Prepare handler consumes the request, records the status as RECEIVEDa. Bulk Prepare handler then validates the Bulk and changes state to PENDING if the validation is successfulb. One validation rule proposed in addition, here is to reject a bulk if there are duplicate transfer IDs used in the bulk itself.\nc. [1.4] If validation fails, Bulk Prepare handler changes the bulkTransferState to PENDING_INVALID (an internal state) and produces a message onto the bulk processing topic   i. Bulk processing Handler then updates the bulkTransferState to REJECTED and sends a notification to the Payer  \n[1.4] [Continuing 2.a] Bulk Prepare handler breaks down the bulk into individual transfers and puts each of them on the prepare topica. As part of this, each transfer is individually assigned the 'expiration time' of the bulk Transfer itself (and other fields necessary for individual transfers)\n[1.5, 1.6, 1.7] Prepare handler, Position handler are refactored to handle individual transfers in a bulk, using flags such as type, action, status, etc.\na. Reservation of funds --> This is left to the individual handlers and the whole bulk is then aggregated in the Bulk Processing Handler.  \n[1.8] Position Handler produces messages corresponding to individual transfers that are part of a bulk to bulk processing topic  \n[1.9] For every message consumed from the bulk processing topic a check is made on the Bulk processing Handler to see if that’s the last individual transfer in a bulk for that processing phase.\n[1.10, 1.11, 1.12] If it is the last transfer, aggregate the state of all the individual transfers anda. If all of them are in reserved state --> Send POST /bulkTransfers to the Payee (by producing a message to the notifications topic which is then consumed by the notification handler)b. Once the bulkTransfer prepare request is sent to the Payee, then change status to ACCEPTED  \nIn a successful case of Prepare - when the PUT from the Payee FSP for bulkFulfil is received, a notification is put on the bulk fulfil topic with a reference to the actual Fulfil message that's stored in an Object store.  \nThis is to be consumed by the bulkFulfilHandler, which then changes state to PROCESSING.  \nThe bulk-fulfil-handler breaks down the bulk into individual transfers and sends each of them through the refactored Fulfil, Position Handlers to commit/abort each of them based on the PUT /bulkTransfers/{ID} message by the Payee and commit/release funds on the Switch  \nThe bulk-processing-handler is to then aggregate all the individual transfer results and change the state of bulkTransfer to COMPLETED/REJECTED based on success/failurea. If the Payee sends COMMITTED for even one of the individual transfers the proposal is to change bulk state to COMPLETED.\nb. However, for step-8 or if the Payee sends REJECTED as bulkTransferState then final state on Switch should be REJECTED.  \nSend notifications to both Payer and Payee (similar to Single transfers, though diverging from the Spec 1.0). The Payer-FSP receives the notification that includes an exhaustive list of individual transfers, same as the list present in the prepare request sent by the Payer. The Payee-FSP receives a notification only for sub-set of transfers, which were sent to it from the Switch as the Bulk prepare request (that were able to be reserved at the Switch).  \n\n4. Implementation Details\n4.1 Bulk Transfer States\nBelow are the states of a Bulk transfer as per the Mojaloop API Specification\n\nRECEIVED  \nPENDING  \nACCEPTED  \nPROCESSING  \nCOMPLETED  \nREJECTED\nInternal state - PENDING_PREPARE (mapped to PENDING)\nInternal state - PENDING_INVALID (mapped to PENDING)\nInternal state - PENDING_FULFIL (mapped to PROCESSING)\nInternal state - EXPIRING (mapped to PROCESSING)\nInternal state - EXPIRED (mapped to COMPLETED)\nInternal state - INVALID (mapped to REJECTED)\nAdditional micro-states may be added for internal use on the Switch\n\n4.2 Proposed New tables\nBelow are the proposed tables as part of designing the Bulk transfers\n\nbulkTransfer\nbulkTransferStateChange\nbulkTransferError\nbulkTransferDuplicateCheck\nbulkTransferFulfilment\nbulkTransferFulfilmentDuplicateCheck\nbulkTransferAssociation\nbulkTransferExtension\nbulkTransferState\nbulkProcessingState\n\n4.3 Internal Type-Action-Status combinations\n1.

Roadmap Topics\n\nRe-assess the need to support multiple Payee FSPs as part of a Bulk and the changes to the Specification needed.\nIssues, learnings from the PoC that are documented are addressed in order of priority\nFind out a need to support something like a Bulk make resource (/bulkMake ?) in which the Switch accepts an entire Bulk as it is and then takes care of all three phases - lookup, quote and transfers.\nThrottling of individual transfers in a bulk?\nThe aspect of ordering in a Bulk - the order of processing at the Switch and at the FSPs. Recommendation to Scheme to incorporate Rule to mandate all FSPs to process transactions a bulk in the existing order and not have preferential processing. On the Switch currently being neutral with ordering but best practice is to sort in ascending order of amounts and process.\nFor Settlements with bulk transfers where Government payments are involved with large sums of money needs to be discussed to allow for moving through transfers without strict liquidity rules needs to be discussed.\nImplement GET /bulkTransfers\nImplement notifications/logging for all bulk negative scenarios\nFull unit tests code coverage\nIntegration testing of successful bulk transfer (golden path)\nRegression testing, including negative scenarios\n\n"},"mojaloop-technical-overview/central-bulk-transfers/transfers/1.1.0-bulk-prepare-transfer-request-overview.html":{"url":"mojaloop-technical-overview/central-bulk-transfers/transfers/1.1.0-bulk-prepare-transfer-request-overview.html","title":"Bulk

Settlement\nmodels can be defined by scheme administrators, and have the following\ncharacteristics:\n\nThey can support settlement either gross or net settlements. If gross, then\na settlement is executed after each transfer is completed. If net, a group\nof transfers is settled together.\n\nThey can support either multilateral or bilateral settlements. If\nsettlements are multilateral, each participant settles with the scheme for\nthe net of its transfers which are included in the settlement. If they are\nmultilateral, each participant settles separately with each of the other\nparticipants and the scheme is not a party to the settlement.\n\nThey can support either deferred or immediate settlements. If settlements\nare immediate, they are actioned immediately they are completed. If they are\ndeferred, they are actioned after a period of delay.\n\nThey can support continuous or discontinuous settlements. Discontinuous\nsettlements require a formal approval from a resource outside the system to\nconfirm that they have been completed. Continuous settlements can be\napproved from within the switch, provided that the criteria for approval are\nmet.\n\nThey can require liquidity support or not.\n\n\nLedger account type\nA ledger account type defines a type of internal account. Current values are:\n\nPOSITION. Accounts of this type are used for provisioning transfers\n\nSETTLEMENT. Accounts of this type are intended to be reflections of\nSettlement Accounts held at the Settlement Bank\n\nHUB_RECONCILIATION. Each implementation of the switch has one account of\nthis type for each currency supported by the switch, owned by the virtual\nDFSP which represents the Hub in the implementation. The account is used\nduring FUNDS IN/OUT operations to represent movements in participants’\nSETTLEMENT accounts.\n\nHUB_MULTILATERAL_SETTLEMENT. Each implementation of the switch has one\naccount of this type for each currency supported by the switch, owned by the\nvirtual DFSP which represents the Hub in the implementation. This account\ntype is used to record counterparty information for net amounts paid to or\nfrom participants as part of settlements. Entries in this account represent\nbalancing values corresponding with the net value in a participant’s\nPOSITION account for a given settlement.\n\nHUB_FEE. Accounts of this type represent accounts into which fees are\ncollected, or from which they are disbursed. (Not implemented)\n\n\nLedger entry type\nA ledger entry type categorises the type of funds which are the content of a\ntransfer and which are due to or from a participant as a consequence of that\ntransfer. The current values are:\n\nPRINCIPLE_VALUE. This designates the funds moved as the content of a\ntransfer in the Interoperability API Specification sense of that term (i.e.\nthe amount.amount item in the Transaction object described in\nSection 7.4.17 of the Interoperability API specification.) It should be\nspelt “principal.”\n\nINTERCHANGE_FEE. This designates fees paid between participants in the\nsystem. (Not implemented)\n\nHUB_FEE. This designates fees paid between participants and the scheme. (Not\nimplemented)\n\nPOSITION_DEPOSIT. This is used to designate funds transfers which are\nintended to increase the value of the position in a particular ledger\naccount. (Not implemented)\n\nPOSITION_WITHDRAWAL. This is used to designate funds transfers which are\nintended to reduce the value of the position in a particular ledger account.\n(Not implemented)\n\nSETTLEMENT_NET_RECIPIENT. This is used to designate funds which a\nparticipant is owed by the counterparty as part of a settlement (in a\nmultilateral settlement model, the counterparty will be the hub; in a\nbilateral settlement model, it will be another party.)\n\nSETTLEMENT_NET_SENDER. This is used to designate funds which a participant\nowes to the counterparty as part of a settlement (in a multilateral\nsettlement model, the counterparty will be the hub; in a bilateral\nsettlement model, it will be another party.)\n\nSETTLEMENT_NET_ZERO. This is used to generate formal records where a\nparticipant’s net position in a settlement is zero.\n\nRECORD_FUNDS_IN. This is used to record funds deposited by a participant to\nthe SETTLEMENT account.\n\nRECORD_FUNDS_OUT. This is used to record funds withdrawn by a participant\nfrom the SETTLEMENT account.\n\n\nThe last seven of these types relate to the internal structure of the switch and\nshould be neither visible to nor modifiable by a scheme. The first three fall\ninto a category which is expected to be extensible by the scheme. The table does\nnot currently have an indicator to mark this distinction, but one is proposed in\nSection TODO.\nParticipant role types\nA participant role type defines the role that a particular participant is\nplaying in a given transaction. The current values of this table are:\n\nPAYER_DFSP. The participant is the debtor in a transfer.\n\nPAYEE_DFSP. The participant is a creditor in a transfer.\n\nHUB. The participant is representing the scheme, and may be either the\ncreditor or the debtor in a transaction.\n\nDFSP_SETTLEMENT. The participant represents the settlement account of a\nparticipant in the scheme. It may be either the creditor or the debtor in a\ntransaction. It is used during FUNDS IN/OUT operations. This is used for\nentries whose counterparty is an entry in the HUB account.\n\nDFSP_POSITION. The participant represents the position of a participant in\nthe scheme. It may be either the creditor or the debtor in a transaction. It\nis used during the settlement process. This is used for entries whose\ncounterparty is an entry in the HUB account.\n\n\nSettlement states\nA settlement may be in a number of possible states. The states currently\nsupported are:\n\nPENDING_SETTLEMENT. A new settlement consisting of one or more settlement\nwindows has been created. The net amounts due to or from each participant\nhave been calculated and a report detailing these net amounts has been\nproduced.\n\nPS_TRANSFERS_RECORDED: all the calculated net amounts for the settlement\nhave been converted into transfers between the creditor and debtor accounts.\nIt is applied for each settlement entry and at settlement level, when all\nentries are recorded. This state is not applied to settlement windows.\n\nPS_TRANSFERS_RESERVED: all the funds required for settlement have been\nreserved (debit amounts only.) It is applied for each settlement entry and\nat settlement level, when all entries are reserved.\n\nPS_TRANSFERS_COMMITTED: all the credit amounts required as part of the\nsettlement have been committed. It is applied for each settlement entry and\nat settlement level, when all entries are committed.\n\nSETTLING: It is used only at settlement level if all accounts are not yet\nsettled.\n\nSETTLED: This state is applied to settlement accounts in\nPS_TRANSFERS_COMMITTED state. When applied to even one account, the\nsettlement will transit to SETTLING state. When all accounts in a window are\nSETTLED, the settlement window will change from PENDING_SETTLEMENT to\nSETTLED, while the settlement is still in SETTLING state. When all accounts\nfrom all windows are SETTLED, the settlement will be changed to SETTLED. It\nis possible for a settlement to change directly from PS_TRANSFERS_COMMITTED\nto SETTLED if all accounts are settled with one request.\n\nABORTED: the settlement could not be completed and should be rolled back. It\nis currently only possible to abort a settlement if the state is one of:\nPENDING_SETTLEMENT, PS_TRANSFERS_RECORDED or PS_TRANSFERS_RESERVED. After\nhaving even one account in PS_TRANSFERS_COMMITTED state (even if the\nsettlement as a whole is still in PS_TRANSFERS_RESERVED), a request to abort\nthe settlement is rejected. It should be noted that this prevents abortion\nin cases such as the default of a participant midway through the settlement\nprocess.\n\n\nThe present data model contains a foreign key to the enumeration table\ncontaining settlement states from the\nsettlementParticipantCurrencyStateChange table, which maps onto a table\nwhich contains a record for each participant/currency/account type combination.\nAssumption: this means that the states appropriate to a settlement are also to\nbe applied to the individual elements of a settlement. As a consequence, the\ndescriptions should be taken to refer to individual settlement amounts as well\nas to the settlement as a whole.\nSettlement window states\nA settlement is made up of one or more settlement windows. Each settlement\nwindow has a state associated with it. The current values of this table are as\nfollows:\n\nOPEN: the settlement window can have ledger movements added to it.\n\nCLOSED: the settlement window cannot have any additional ledger movements\nadded to it. It is available for settlement.\n\nPENDING_SETTLEMENT: the settlement window’s contents have been included in a\nsettlement request, but this request is a request for deferred settlement\nwhich has not yet been completed.\n\nSETTLED: the scheme has confirmed that the obligations incurred by\nparticipants as a consequence of the settlement to which this settlement\nwindow belongs have been met by those participants and the settlement is\ntherefore complete.\n\nABORTED: the settlement to which this settlement window belongs did not\ncomplete. The settlement window is available to be included in another\nsettlement.\n\n\nTransfer states\nEach transaction which passes through the system can be assigned one of a fixed\nnumber of states. The current values of this state are:\n\nRECEIVED_PREPARE: the switch has received the transaction request.\n\nRESERVED: the switch has reserved the funds required to cover the\ntransaction.\n\nRECEIVED_FULFIL: the switch has received the fulfilment request, and the\ntransaction has been assigned to a settlement window\n\nCOMMITTED: the transaction has been committed.\n\nFAILED: the transaction has failed in some unspecified way and has been\naborted. (Not implemented)\n\nRESERVED_TIMEOUT: the transaction has timed out while in the reserved state\nand has been aborted.\n\nRECEIVED_REJECT: the transaction has been rejected by the payee DFSP and\nshould be aborted.\n\nABORTED_REJECTED: the transaction has been aborted by the switch as a\nconsequence of its having been rejected by the payee DFSP.\n\nRECEIVED_ERROR: the transaction was not received correctly by the payee DFSP\nand should be aborted.\n\nABORTED_ERROR: the transaction has been aborted by the switch as a\nconsequence of its not having been received correctly.\n\nEXPIRED_PREPARED: the transaction has expired during the prepare process and\nhas been aborted.\n\nEXPIRED_RESERVED: the transaction has timed out during the reservation\nprocess and has been aborted.\n\nINVALID: the transaction has failed the switch’s internal validation process\nand has been aborted.\n\n\nTransfers and transactions\nTransfers define a movement of funds in the system. There is a table in the\nswitch which has this name. Some entries in this table are the consequence of\nexternal movements which are generated by scheme participants and processed by\nthe switch; others are internally generated by the switch (e.g. to record net\nmovements of funds associated with settlements.)\nIt may be a source of confusion that, although “transfers” is a term used e.g.\nin the Interoperability API specification to designate the movement of funds\nbetween participants, it is used as the name of a table in the switch which\nstores other types of funds movement as well.\nThis document will therefore adopt the following convention:\n\n“Transfers” refers to the content of instructions issued using the\n/transfers resource of the Interoperability API definition. (see Section\n6.7 of the Interoperability API definition.)\n\n“Transactions” refers to all movements of funds which are tracked by the\nswitch.\n\n\nIn scope and out of scope \nIn scope\nThe following functional items are in scope:\n\nRequesting a settlement by currency\n\nRequesting a settlement by currency and settlement model\n\n\nOut of scope\nBusiness rules\nHow do things happen now?\nThis section describes how the current settlement process works.\nCategorisation\nThe process leading to settlement is initially defined by entries in the\nparticipantCurrency table. This table holds a record for each combination of:\n\nParticipant\n\nCurrency\n\nLedger account type (see Section 2.2 above.)\n\n\nRecording positions\nEach entry in this table has a corresponding entry in the participantPosition\ntable. This table stores the current committed and reserved positions for each\nof the combinations described above. Each change to the positions in this table\nis documented by an entry in the participantPositionChange table, which refers\nthe change back to the transfer table and thence to the authoritative record\nof transactions.\nAssigning transactions to settlement windows\nAs each transfer is fulfilled, a record is created for it in the\ntransferFulfilment table. This record contains a link to the currently open\nsettlement window.\nRecords may be created for transactions which are not transfers. Non-transfer\ntransactions have their ilpFulfilment set to 0.\nThe settlement API described in Ref_2 above contains a resource\n(closeSettlementWindow) to allow an administrator to close a settlement\nwindow and create a new one. The resource takes a settlement window ID as part\nof the query string, together with a string describing the status to be assigned\nand a string describing the reason for the change of status. In-line\ndocumentation for the resource states: “If the settlementWindow is open, it can\nbe closed and a new window is created. If it is already closed, return an error\nmessage. Returns the new settlement window.”\nSettlement windows can only be passed a status of CLOSED using this resource.\nInitiating a settlement\nThe initiation of a settlement is initiated by making a call triggered by the\nscheme making a POST to the /settlements resource in the settlement API.\nThe caller gives a reason for the settlement request. This is a synchronous\ncall, whose return is described in Section 4.1.5 below. Internally, the\ninitiation is marked by the creation of a record in the settlement table and\nthe association of a number of settlement window records in the\nsettlementWindow table with the settlement created. This says: I want this\nsettlement to contain these settlement windows. Each of the settlement windows\nselected to form part of this settlement must have the status CLOSED or ABORTED.\nWhen selected to form part of a settlement, the status of each window should be\nchanged to PENDING_SETTLEMENT. The status of the settlement itself should also\nbe set to PENDING_SETTLEMENT.\nCalculating the content of a settlement\nWhen a settlement has been requested and the windows which it will contain have\nbeen selected, the switch produces an aggregation of the content of the proposed\nsettlement at the following levels:\n\nSettlement window (from settlementWindow)\n\nParticipant (from participantCurrency)\n\nCurrency (from participantCurrency)\n\nAccount type (from participantCurrency)\n\nParticipant role type (from transferParticipant)\n\nLedger entry type (from transferParticipant)\n\n\nThis query can be provisioned from the database FK links from settlement to\nsettlementwindow, to transferFulfilment (all fulfilled transfers), to\ntransfer, to transferParticipant. The amount is taken from the\ntransferParticipant table. Correct!\nOnly transfers are included in a settlement. This is implied by the first\naggregation criterion above (Settlement window) and the fact that only transfers\nare assigned to the current OPEN window when a transferFulfilment record is\ncreated. All COMMITTED transactions should have an entry in the\ntransferFulfilment table.\nThe results of this query are used to construct a number of records in the\nsettlementParticipantCurrency table, representing the net amount due to or\nfrom each participant and currency in the settlement as a consequence of the\nsettlement. For a given settlement, these records are segmented by: Correct!\n\nParticipant (from participantCurrency)\n\nCurrency (from participantCurrency)\n\nAccount type (from participantCurrency)\n\n\nThis report is used as the basis of the information returned from the initial\nPOST to the /createSettlement resource of the settlement API (see\nSection 4.1.4 above.)\nBilateral settlements are not currently implemented.\nCreating position records for the settlement\nA record is inserted in the transfer table for each net amount calculated in\nthe previous step when the settlement account transitions from\nPENDING_SETTLEMENT to PS_TRANSFERS_RECORDED. Please note that PS stands for\nPENDING_SETTLEMENT. Each of these records will have the account type SETTLEMENT.\nThe ledger entry type will be SETTLEMENT_NET_SENDER, SETTLEMENT_NET_RECIPIENT or\nSETTLEMENT_NET_ZERO depending on whether the participant owes money to the\nscheme, is owed money by the scheme or is neutral in the settlement,\nrespectively. The transfer participant type is HUB for the Hub participant and\nDFSP_POSITION for the DFSP participant. The account type is imposed by the\nparticipant currency – for the Hub participant it is the\nHUB_MULTILATERAL_SETTLEMENT and for the DFSP participant it is the POSITION\naccount. This enables the switch to reset the participant’s position when the\nwindow enters the PS_TRANSFERS_COMMITTED state.\nProgress of the settlement\nAs the scheme verifies that participants have settled the amounts due from them,\nthe scheme administrator can update the switch with this information.\nUpdating the status of settlement windows\nThree methods of performing this update are supported. Each of these methods is\ndiscussed in more detail below.\nupdateSettlementById\nAn administrator may issue a PUT to the /updateSettlementById resource\non the settlement API, giving the settlement ID of the settlement they wish to\nupdate as part of the query (e.g. PUT\n/updateSettlementById/settlements/123.) The content of the request is as\nfollows:\n\nA state to be assigned to the participants required. The state is\nconstrained to be either ABORTED or INVALID\n\nA reason for the change of state.\n\nAn external reference for the change.\n\nAn array of participants to which the status is to be applied. The following\ninformation is given for each participant:\n\nThe ID of the participant. This is the internal Mojaloop ID of the\nparticipant.\n\nAn array of accounts. The content of each account is as follows:\n\nAn ID. The description characterises this as the participant’s\ncurrency ID QUESTION: Is this correct? It is an integer, where a\nVARCHAR(3) would be expected.\n\nA reason. A string which presumably can contain anything.\n\nThe state of the settlement for the account. This is not constrained\nby an enum, but is a simple string. It is not clear how this status\nrelates to the overall state given in Item 1 above.\n\nAn external reference for the change in state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  A call to this API resource may contain either items 1-3 above or an\n  array of accounts as specified in item 4 above, but not both. If it contains\n  items 1-3 above, then all the items must be present. If these rules are\n  breached, then the switch will reject the request.\n\nupdateSettlementBySettlementParticipant\nAn administrator may issue a PUT to the\n/updateSettlementBySettlementParticipant resource on the settlement API,\ngiving the settlement ID and the participant ID of the parts of the settlement\nthey wish to update as part of the query (e.g. PUT\n/updateSettlementByParticipant/settlements/123/participants/56789.) The\ncontent of the request is as follows:\n\nAn array of state changes, whose content is as follows:\n\nThe currency ID whose status is to be changed. This is an integer, where\na VARCHAR(3) would be expected.\n\nA reason for the state change.\n\nThe state requested. This is a string, where an enumeration would be\nexpected.\n\nAn external reference for the change in state.\n\n\n\n\nNote that this is an array with the same structure as that described in item 4\nof Section 5.1.7.1 above, although it is defined separately in the API\ndefinition.\nupdateSettlementBySettlementParticipantAccount\nAn administrator may issue a PUT to the\n/updateSettlementBySettlementParticipantAccount resource on the settlement\nAPI, giving the settlement ID, the participant ID and the account ID of the part\nof the settlement they wish to update as part of the query (e.g. PUT\n/updateSettlementByParticipant/settlements/123/participants/56789/accounts/1.)\nThe content of the request is as follows:\n\nThe state requested. This is a string, where an enumeration would be\nexpected.\n\nA reason. A string which presumably can contain anything.\n\nAn external reference for the change in state.\n\n\nNote that this is a structure with most of the same members as the structure\ndefined in Item 1 of Section 5.1.7.2 above, although the items appear in a\ndifferent order.\nHow changes in settlement window state are processed\nThe action taken in response to these calls depends on the status assigned to\nthe account. In any case, a record is created in the\nsettlementParticipantCurrencyStateChange table, giving the state identifier,\nthe reason and an external reference for the change.\nThere is a sequence of steps defined for a settlement. Each step must be\nfollowed in order, and no steps may be omitted. The sequence of steps is\nhard-coded into the application and is as follows:\n\nPENDING_SETTLEMENT\n\nPS_TRANSFERS_RECORDED\n\nPS_TRANSFERS_RESERVED\n\nPS_TRANSFERS_COMMITTED\n\nSETTLED\n\n\nA settlement can be aborted provided no account in the settlement has reached a\nstatus of PS_TRANSFERS_COMMITTED.\nThe following actions are taken on each change of status:\nPENDING_SETTLEMENT to PS_TRANSFERS_RECORDED\nA record is generated in the transfer table to record the change in state.\nThe parties to this transfer are the POSITION account type and the\nHUB_MULTILATERAL_SETTLEMENT type. If the participant account is a net creditor\nfor the settlement, then the ledger entry type will be set to\nSETTLEMENT_NET_RECIPIENT. If the participant account is a net debtor for the\nsettlement, then the ledger entry type will be set to SETTLEMENT_NET_SENDER. If\nthe participant account is neutral for the settlement, then the ledger entry\ntype will be set to SETTLEMENT_NET_ZERO.\nA record is also created in the transferstatechange table with the\nRECEIVED_PREPARE state, which means that no positions have been changed.\nWhen the last participating account is changed to PS_TRANSFERS_RECORDED, then\nthe settlement’s status is also changed to PS_TRANSFERS_RECORDED.\nIf an administrator attempts to change an account’s state to\nPS_TRANSFERS_RECORDED and either the settlement’s state or the settlement\naccount’s state is not PENDING_SETTLEMENT or PS_TRANSFERS_RECORDED, then the\nrequest will be rejected.\nPS_TRANSFERS_RECORDED to PS_TRANSFERS_RESERVED\nA new record is created in the transferstatechange table for the transfer\nthat was created in section 5.1.7.2 above. This record will have a status of\nRESERVED. If the participant is a net creditor as a result of the settlement,\nthen a record will also be created in the participantPositionChange table if the\naccount being reserved is for a net creditor in the settlement, as defined in\nSection 5.1.7.2 above. The Net Debit Cap is checked at this point, and if the\ncurrent position exceeds the Net Debit Cap, then the Net Debit Cap is\nautomatically adjusted by the amount of the net credit due to the account as\npart of the settlement and the participant is sent a notification of the new Net\nDebit Cap value and its currency.\nWhen the last participating account is changed to PS_TRANSFERS_RESERVED, then\nthe settlement’s status is also changed to PS_TRANSFERS_RESERVED.\nIf an administrator attempts to change an account’s state to\nPS_TRANSFERS_RESERVED and either the settlement’s state or the settlement\naccount’s state is not PS_TRANSFERS_RECORDED or PS_TRANSFERS_RESERVED, then the\nrequest will be rejected.\nPS_TRANSFERS_RESERVED to PS_TRANSFERS_COMMITTED\nA new record is created in the transferstatechange table for the transfer\nthat was created in section 5.1.7.2 above. This record will have a status of\nCOMMITTED. If the participant is a net debtor as a result of the settlement,\nthen a record will also be created in the participantPositionChange table if the\naccount being reserved is for a net debtor in the settlement, as defined in\nSection 5.1.7.2 above.\nWhen the last participating account is changed to PS_TRANSFERS_COMMITTED, then\nthe settlement’s status is also changed to PS_TRANSFERS_COMMITTED.\nIf an administrator attempts to change an account’s state to\nPS_TRANSFERS_COMMITTED and either the settlement’s state or the settlement\naccount’s state is not to PS_TRANSFERS_RESERVED or PS_TRANSFERS_COMMITTED, then\nthe request will be rejected.\nPS_TRANSFERS_COMMITTED to SETTLED\nWhen the first account is changed to a status of SETTLED, the settlement’s state\nis changed to SETTLING.\nWhen the last participating account is changed to SETTLED, then the settlement’s\nstatus is also changed to SETTLED.\nIf an administrator attempts to change an account’s state to SETTLED and either\nthe settlement’s state or the settlement account’s state is not to\nPS_TRANSFERS_COMMITTED or SETTLED, then the request will be rejected.\nAborting the settlement\nIf there is any failure in the scheme’s process for recovering the amounts due\nfrom participants in a settlement, the scheme can update the switch with this\ninformation by issuing a PUT to the /updateSettlementById resource of\nthe settlement API and setting the state value of the content of the message\nto ABORTED. A PUT call on the /updateSettlementById resource is the only\nmethod which may be used for ABORTING a settlement. If any account information\nis given in the call, then neither the state nor the reason nor the\nexternalReference fields may be set. if the state value is set at the\ntop level of the call, then the reason field must also be set, and the\nrequest will be rejected if any account information is given in the call.\nIf an attempt is made to abort a settlement, and any of the accounts in the\nsettlement have the status PS_TRANSFERS_COMMITTED or SETTLED, then the request\nwill be rejected.\nWhen a call is received, a new record is created in the\nsettlementParticipantCurrencyStateChange table, and is given the appropriate\nstatus based on the status reported by the caller. Depending on the update that\nwas received, this may also require the status of the transaction and that of\nthe participant position to be updated. No, it is done at settlement level for\nthe entire settlement and all entries in settlementParticipantCurrency are\naffected.\nNote: if the settlement is bilateral, then there is no obvious reason to abort\nthe entire settlement if one interchange fails. We should think about this use\ncase and how we would want to represent it. This document does not consider this\nuse case.\nAborting a settlement comprises the following steps:\n\nThe status of the transfers created in Section 5.1.6 above should be changed\nto ABORTED.\n\nA new record is added to the settlementParticipantCurrencyStateChange\ntable for each of the participant records in the settlement. This record has\na status of ABORTED, and the currentStateChangeId column in the\nsettlementParticipantCurrency table for that participant record is\nchanged to point to this new record.\n\nA new record is added to the settlementWindowStateChange table for each\nsettlement window in the settlement. This record has a status of ABORTED,\nand the currentStateChangeId column in the settlementWindow table for\nthat window is changed to point to this new record.\n\nA new record is added to the settlementStateChange table for the\nsettlement. This record has a status of ABORTED, and the\ncurrentStateChangeId column in the settlement table is changed to\npoint to this new record.\n\nIf positions have been reserved for net creditors as a result of the\nsettlement (see Section 5.1.7.3 above,) then a balancing entry will be\ncreated in the participantPositionChange table to reverse the\nreservation of funds. This action does not at present reverse any change to\nthe account’s Net Debit Cap that may have been made as a consequence of this\nreservation.\n\nAny records created in the transfers table (see Section 5.1.7.2 above)\nwill have their state changed in two steps by adding records to the\ntransferStateChange table. The first step will change the transfer state\nto REJECTED. The second step will change the state to ABORTED.\n\n\nQuestion: should there be/is there a time-out after which a settlement will be\naborted if it has not completed? If there is, how is it set? No, there isn’t\ntimeout on a settlement level. But when transfers are prepared (for\nPS_TRANSFERS_RECORED) expiration is set on a transfer level. Its value is\ncontrolled by a Config.TRANSFER_VALIDITY_SECONDS, which currently defaults to\n432000 seconds, which equals 5 days. It is big enough to avoid expiration.\nStill, if that happens, it would leave the data in an unrecoverable by the API\nstate. This is very good point and should be certainly addressed with the next\nincrement!\nRecording the deposit of funds\nAs participants are informed of their liabilities under the settlement, it is\nexpected that they will deposit funds in their settlement account to cover those\nliabilities. These activities are recorded via the central ledger administration\ninterface resource recordFundsIn.\nThis action is called through a POST to the administration interface, giving the\nname of the participant and the account to be credited in the form POST\n/participants/{participantName}/accounts/{accountId} (e.g. POST\n/participants/myDfsp/accounts/1234) The content of this message is as follows.\n\ntransferId: a UUID to be used to identify the transfer in the switch.\n\nexternalReference: a reference used to identify the transfer for the\nadministrator\n\naction: this should be set to “recordFundsIn” for recording funds in.\n\nreason: the reason why the transfer is being made.\n\namount: the amount of the transfer.\n\namount: the actual amount being transferred\n\ncurrency: the ISO 4217 code of the currency of the deposit.\n\n\n\nextensionList: a series of key/value pairs which are used to carry\nadditional information\n\n\nWhen an administrator records that a participant has deposited funds to an\naccount, the amount deposited is recorded in an entry in the transfer table.\nThe parties to the transfer are recorded by entries in the\ntransferParticipant table, with a ledger account type of the type requested\nin the POST for the participant and HUB_RECONCILIATION for the balancing entry.\nFor deposits, the participant account will be the creditor and the\nHUB_RECONCILIATION account the debtor. The application will currently reject\nrequests to this interface which do not have a ledger account type of\nSETTLEMENT.\nA deposit goes through the following changes of state:\n\nA record is created for the transfer in the transferStateChange table\nwith a state of RECEIVED_PREPARE.\n\nNext, a record is created in the transferStateChange table with the\nstate RESERVED. This also creates a record in the\nparticipantPositionChange table to record the reservation of funds in\nthe HUB_RECONCILIATION account, and the participantPosition table’s\nvalue for that account is updated.\n\nFinally, a record is created in the transferStateChange table with the\nstate COMMITTED. After this act, records are created in the\nparticipantPositionChange table for the creditor account to record the\ncompletion of the deposit, and the appropriate record in the\nparticipantPosition table has its balance updated.\n\n\nThese changes of state are simply chained together in sequence. There is no\ninterval or trigger between the steps.\nThis activity has no direct effect on the settlement process or on the Net Debit\nCap.\nRecording the withdrawal of funds\nAt various times, participants may wish to withdraw funds from their settlement\naccounts: for instance, if they are long-term net beneficiaries of transfers and\nare building up a surplus of liquidity. These activities are recorded via a\ntwo-phase process. In the first phase, the funds for the proposed withdrawal are\nreserved via the central ledger administration interface resource\nrecordFundsOutPrepareReserve. In the second phase, the withdrawal is\ncommitted via the recprdFundsOutCommit resource or aborted through the\nrecordFundsOutAbort resource.\nThese activities are defined below.\nrecordFundsOutPrepareReserve\nThis action is called through a POST to the administration interface, giving the\nname of the participant and the account to be credited (e.g. POST\n/participants/myDfsp/accounts/1234) The content of this message is as follows.\n\ntransferId: a UUID to be used to identify the transfer in the switch.\n\nexternalReference: a reference used to identify the transfer for the\nadministrator\n\naction: this should be set to “recordFundsOutPrepareReserve” for recording\nfunds withdrawals.\n\nreason: the reason why the transfer is being made.\n\namount: the amount of the transfer.\n\namount: the actual amount being transferred\n\ncurrency: the ISO 4217 code of the currency of the deposit.\n\n\n\nextensionList: a series of key/value pairs which are used to carry\nadditional information\n\n\nWhen an administrator records that a participant has requested the withdrawal of\nfunds from an account, the amount to be withdrawn is recorded in an entry in the\ntransfer table. The parties to the transfer are recorded by entries in the\ntransferParticipant table, with a ledger account type of the type requested\nin the POST for the participant and HUB_RECONCILIATION for the balancing entry.\nFor withdrawals, the participant account will be the debtor and the\nHUB_RECONCILIATION account the creditor. The application will currently reject\nrequests to this interface which do not have a ledger account type of\nSETTLEMENT.\nReservation of a withdrawal goes through the following changes of state:\n\nA record is created for the transfer in the transferStateChange table\nwith a state of RECEIVED_PREPARE.\n\nNext, a record is created in the transferStateChange table with the\nstate RESERVED. This also creates a record in the\nparticipantPositionChange table to record the reservation of funds in\nthe participant’s settlement account, and the participantPosition\ntable’s value for that account is updated.\n\n\nThese changes of state are simply chained together in sequence. There is no\ninterval or trigger between the steps.recordFundsOutCommit\nThis action is called through a POST to the administration interface, giving the\nname of the participant and the account to be credited (e.g. POST\n/participants/myDfsp/accounts/1234) The content of this message is as follows.\n\ntransferId: a UUID to be used to tie the commit to the preceding reservation\nin the switch.\n\nexternalReference: a reference used to identify the transfer for the\nadministrator\n\naction: this should be set to “recordFundsOutCommit” for recording funds\ncommitments.\n\nreason: the reason why the transfer is being made.\n\namount: the amount of the transfer.\n\namount: the actual amount being transferred\n\ncurrency: the ISO 4217 code of the currency of the deposit.\n\n\n\nextensionList: a series of key/value pairs which are used to carry\nadditional information\n\n\nWhen an administrator records that a participant wants to commit the withdrawal\nof funds from an account, the original entry in the transfer table is\nidentified. The parties to the transfer are recorded by entries in the\ntransferParticipant table, with a ledger account type of the type requested\nin the POST for the participant and HUB_RECONCILIATION for the balancing entry.\nFor withdrawals, the participant account will be the debtor and the\nHUB_RECONCILIATION account the creditor. The application will currently reject\nrequests to this interface which do not have a ledger account type of\nSETTLEMENT.\nCommitment of a withdrawal goes through the following changes of state: a record\nis created in the transferStateChange table with the state COMMITTED. After\nthis act, records are created in the participantPositionChange table for the\ncreditor account to record the completion of the deposit, and the appropriate\nrecord in the participantPosition table has its balance updated. These\nchanges of state are simply chained together in sequence. There is no interval\nor trigger between the steps.\nThis activity has no direct effect on the settlement process or on the Net Debit\nCap.\nProposed enhancements\nThis section describes the enhancements to the existing OSS settlement process\n(described in Section 4.1 above) which are proposed. Each enhancement is shown\nin a separate section and, where there are dependencies between enhancements,\nthese are listed in the enhancement’s description.\nRequest settlement by currency [EPIC]\nThe following changes are required to support settling separately for different\ncurrencies.\nDatabase changes\nThe following changes are required to support multi-currency settlement.\nAddition of a settlementWindowContent table [Story #1]\nA new table will be added to the database. The name of this table will be\nsettlementWindowContent. The table will contain an entry for each item of\ncontent in a given settlement window, broken down by ledger account type and\ncurrency. The full column structure of the table is as follows:\n\n\n\nColumn name\nDescription\nAttributes\n\n\n\n\nsettlementWindowContentId\nAuto-generated key for the record.\nBIGINT(20). Unsigned, not null, primary key, autoincrement\n\n\nsettlementWindowId\nThe settlement window that the record belongs to.\nBIGINT(20). Unsigned, not null.

Foreign key to currency.\n\n\nsettlementWindowContentCurrentState\nThe current state of this entry\nBIGINT(20). Unsigned, not null. Foreign key to settlementWindowContentStateChange\n\n\n\nAddition of a settlementWindowContentStateChange table [Story #2]\nA new table will be added to the database. The name of this table will be\nsettlementWindowContentStateChange. The table will track changes to the\nstatus of entries in the settlementWindowContent table. The full column\nstructure of the table is as follows:\n\n\n\nColumn name\nDescription\nAttributes\n\n\n\n\nsettlementWindowContentStateChangeId\nAuto-generated key for the record.\nBIGINT(20).

[Story #8]\nQueries to filter the records in the settlementContentAggregation table\nrequired for a settlement in a particular currency will need to join across from\nthat table to the participantCurrency table using the\nparticipantCurrencyId column to ascertain the currency to which a particular\nrow refers. The currencyId column is held in the participantCurrency\ntable. [Story #9]\nAdd structures relating to settlement models [Story #4]\nIn order to support the specification of settlement models, which will include\ncurrencies, the database changes specified in Section 6.2.1.1 below should be\nadded to the database.\nSettlement models describing the settlement types required for a given\nimplementation will be developed and tested.[Story #4a]\nChange to settlement table [Story #5]\nThe settlement table in the central ledger database needs to be modified to\nadd a settlementModel column. This column should have the following\ncharacteristics:\n·       The column should be required (NOT NULL) and unsigned.\n·       The column’s data type should be smallint(6)\n·       The column should be defined as a foreign key reference to the\nidsettlementmodel field of the settlementModel table.\nWhen this change is applied to an existing database, a settlement model to\ndescribe the default settlement should be created. The settlementCurrencyId\ncolumn in this model should be left blank (= all currencies.) The\nsettlementModel column in all existing records in the settlement table should be\nset to point to this model’s ID. A script to apply this change should be\ncreated, tested and stored in the repository. [Story #6]\nChanges to processing\nThe following changes to the processing code are required to support\nmulti-currency settlement.\nChange to code supporting closeSettlementWindow resource\nThe existing API described in Ref_2 above provides a single function\n(closeSettlementWindow) to manage settlement windows. This function allows\nits user to select a settlement window by ID number and to input a new status\nfor the window and a reason for that status.\nWhen a settlement window is closed, the code supporting this activity should\nperform two functions, as follows. These functions should be performed in the\nbackground and without impacting system performance.\nGenerate records in the settlementWindowContent table [Story #11]\nThe code should generate a record in the settlementWindowContent table for\neach ledger entry type/currency combination found in the transfers in the\nsettlement window. This information can be obtained from the following query:\nSELECT DISTINCT\n   \\@mySettlementId\n, PC.currencyId\n, PC.ledgerAccountTypeId\nFROM\n   transferFulfilment F\nINNER JOIN transferParticipant P on F.transferId = P.transferId\nINNER JOIN participantCurrency PC on P.participantCurrencyId =\nPC.participantCurrencyId\nWHERE\n   F.settlementWindowId = \\@mySettlementWindowId;\nGenerate records in the settlementContentTransferParticipant table [Story #12]\nThe code should calculate the aggregate values for all transfers which form part\nof that settlement window and store them in the settlementContentAggregation\ntable. Aggregates should be produced for the following segmentation:\n\nParticipant\n\nCurrency\n\nLedger account type\n\nParticipant role type\n\nLedger entry type\n\n\nThe following query will perform this function for a given settlement window:\nINSERT INTO settlementContentAggregation\n   (settlementWindowContentId, participantCurrencyId,\ntransferParticipantRoleTypeId,\nledgerEntryTypeId, amount, createdDate)\nSELECT\n   C.settlementWindowContentId\n, PC.participantCurrencyId\n, P.transferParticipantRoleTypeId\n, P.ledgerEntryTypeId\n, sum(P.amount)\n, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\nFROM\n   transferFulfilment F\nINNER JOIN transferParticipant P on F.transferId = P.transferId\nINNER JOIN participantCurrency PC on P.participantCurrencyId =\nPC.participantCurrencyId\nINNER JOIN settlementWindowContent C ON C.settlementWindowId =\nF.settlementWindowId\n    AND C.ledgerAccountTypeId = PC.ledgerAccountTypeId\n\n AND C.currencyId = PC.currencyId\nWHERE\n   F.settlementWindowId = \\@mySettlementId\nGROUP BY\n   C.settlementWindowContentId\n, PC.participantCurrencyId\n, P.transferParticipantRoleTypeId\n, P.ledgerEntryTypeId\n   ;\ncreateSettlement\nThe parameters for the createSettlement resource should be extended to\ninclude the settlement model for which the settlement is required. [Story #13]\nWhen the settlement is created, the settlement model for which the settlement is\nrequired should be added to the new row in the settlement table.\nWhen a settlement is requested, the switch should check that the settlement\nmodel for which settlement is being requested requires NET settlement and not\nGROSS settlement. If the requested settlement model requires GROSS settlement,\nthen the request should be rejected with an error.\nThe verification procedures associated with the createSettlement resource\nshould be changed to check that some of the settlement windows associated with\nthe proposed settlement contain entries for the settlement model requested. If\nthere are no entries for the settlement model requested for any of the\nsettlement windows requested, then an error should be returned and the\nsettlement request rejected. [Story #14]\nUpdating the progress of a settlement.\nThe process to update the status of a settlement described in Section 5.1.7.1.2\nabove allows the caller to specify the currency whose status is to be changed.\nSince the settlement will now be for a settlement model, this parameter should\nbe removed. [Story #15]\nWhen the status for a settlement participant is updated, this will result in\nchanges to the status of all the records in the settlementContentAggregation\ntable for the given participant. These records can be identified using the\nfollowing query:\nSELECT\nP.settlementContentAggregationId\nFROM\n   settlement S\nINNER JOIN settlementSettlementWindow W ON S.settlementId = W.settlementId\nINNER JOIN settlementModel M ON S.settlementSettlementModelId =\nM.idSettlementModel\nINNER JOIN settlementWindowContent C ON W.settlementWindowId =\nC.settlementWindowId\nINNER JOIN settlementContentAggregation P ON C.settlementWindowContentId =\nP.settlementWindowContentId\nINNER JOIN participantCurrency PC ON P.participantCurrencyId =\nPC.participantCurrencyId\nWHERE\n   S.settlementId = \\@mySettlementId\nAND PC.ledgerAccountTypeId = M.ledgerAccountTypeId\nAND (C.currencyId = M.settlementCurrencyId OR M.settlementCurrencyId IS NULL)\n;\n[Story #16]\nThe code should then check to see if, as a result of the updates to the records\nin settlementContentAggregation, all records for a given combination of\nsettlement window, ledger account type and currency have the same status. If\nthey have, then the appropriate record in the settlementWindowContent table\nshould be updated to have that status.\nThe code should then check to see if all records in the\nsettlementWindowContent table for a given settlement window have the same\nstatus. If they have, then the appropriate record in the settlementWindow\nSupport continuous gross settlement\nContinuous Gross Settlement is a settlement model in which each transaction is\nsettled as soon as it is fulfilled. The following changes are required to\nimplement this change.\nDatabase changes\nThe database changes shown in Section 8 below should be implemented. These can\nbe summarised as follows:\nChanges to support the settlement model\nA number of new tables are required to define a settlement model and to store\nthe enumerations for its definition types. This comprises the following tables\nin the ERD:\n\nSettlementdelay\n\nSettlementinterchange\n\nSettlementmodel\n\nSettlementtype\n\n\nIn addition, the settlementmodel table has foreign keys to two existing\ntables, as follows:\n\nA foreign key to the currency table to enable the settlement model to\nsettle only scheme accounts in a particular currency. If this entry is\nblank, this should be interpreted as saying that the settlement model\nsettles all currencies that are not specified as being settled by other\nsettlement models for the same account type.\n\nA foreign key to the ledgerAccountType table. This specifies that the\nsettlement model settles accounts of this type.\n\n\nChanges to the ledgeraccounttype table\nThe current ledgeraccounttype table stores a number of entries for account\ntypes which should not be used for settlements – for instance,\nHUB_MULTILATERAL_SETTLEMENT. A column should therefore be added to the\nledgeraccounttype table to indicate whether the account type can be attached\nto a settlement model or not. This column is called settleable, and is\nspecified as a Boolean value, NOT NULL and with a default of FALSE.\nOf the existing ledger account types, PRINCIPAL_VALUE, INTERCHANGE_FEE and\nHUB_FEE should be marked as capable of being attached to settlement models (this\nvalue should be TRUE.) For all other ledger account types, the column should be\nset to FALSE. If new ledger account types are added to this table via the\neventual settlement API, then they should have a value of TRUE.\nChanges to the ledgerentrytype table\nImplementation of the TIPS settlement model requires an explicit association\nbetween ledger entry types and the account types in which they should appear.\nSince each ledger entry type should only appear in a single account type, though\nmultiple ledger entry types may appear in a given account type, this is modelled\nby including a foreign key reference to the ledgeraccounttype table as a\ncolumn in the ledgerentrytype table. It should be noted that this applies\nonly to ledger entry types which are associated with a settlement model, as\ndescribed in Section 6.2.1.2 above. The assignment of existing entries in the\ndatabase would be as follows:\n\n\n\nLedger Entry Type\nLedger Account Type\n\n\n\n\nPRINCIPAL_VALUE\nPOSITION\n\n\nINTERCHANGE_FEE\nNew account type required\n\n\nHUB_FEE\nHUB_FEE\n\n\n\nChanges to the settlement table\nThe settlement table should have a column added to it to allow the\nsettlement model to be used in settling it to be specified. The column should be\ncalled settlementModelId. It should have the same data type as the equivalent\nfield in the settlementModel table, and should be a foreign key into that\ntable. It should be defined as not null.\nChanges to the settlementWindow table\nAs well as settlements, individual settlement windows will need to be assigned\nto settlement models. The settlementWindow table should therefore have a\ncolumn added to it to allow the settlement model to be used in settling it to be\nspecified. The column should be called settlementModelId. It should have the\nsame data type as the equivalent field in the settlementModel table, and\nshould be a foreign key into that table. It should be defined as not null.\nThis concludes the list of schema changes required to support the TIPS\nsettlement models\nAPI changes\nAPI Support for the settlement functionality required for TIPS will include the\nfollowing functions:\nClose a settlement window\nThe existing API definition (see Ref_2 above) supports a\ncloseSettlementWindow resource. This function allows its user to select a\nsettlement window by ID number and to input a new status for the window and a\nreason for that status. This resource will retain its current signature, but the\ncode supporting it needs to change as follows.\nWhen a settlement window is closed, the system should create a new settlement\nwindow with the same settlement model as the newly closed settlement window, and\nshould make this the active window.\nWhen a settlement window is closed, the code supporting this activity should\ncalculate the aggregate values for all transfers which form part of that\nsettlement window and store them in the settlementTransferParticipant table.\nAggregates should be produced for the following segmentation:\n\nParticipant\n\nCurrency\n\nLedger account type\n\nParticipant role type\n\nLedger entry type\n\n\nThe following example code will produce the aggregations required for a given\nsettlement window (identified as \\@MyWindow in the example):\nSELECT\nS.settlementId\n, W.settlementWindowId\n, P.participantCurrencyId\n, P.transferParticipantRoleTypeId\n, P.ledgerEntryTypeId\n, SUM(P.amount)\n, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AS createdDate\nFROM\nsettlementWindow W INNER JOIN settlementModel M ON W.settlementModelId =\nM.idsettlementModel\nINNER JOIN settlementSettlementWindow S ON W.settlementWindowId =\nS.settlementWindowId\nINNER JOIN ledgerAccountType L ON M.idsettlementModel = L.settlementModelId\nINNER JOIN transferFulfilment F ON W.settlementWindowId = F.settlementWindowId\nINNER JOIN transferParticipant P ON F.transferId = P.TransferId\nINNER JOIN participantCurrency PC ON P.participantCurrencyId =\nPC.participantCurrencyId\nAND PC.ledgerAccountTypeId = L.ledgerAccountTypeId\nWHERE\nW.settlementWindowId = \\@MyWindow\nAND\n(PC.currencyId = M.settlementcurrencyId OR M.settlementcurrencyId IS NULL)\nGROUP BY\nS.settlementId\n, W.settlementWindowId\n, P.participantCurrencyId\n, P.transferParticipantRoleTypeId\n, P.ledgerEntryTypeId;\nGetting information about a settlement window\nThe existing API definition (see Ref_2 above) supports a\ngetSettlementWindowById resource. This function allows its user to obtain\ninformation about a settlement window by giving the ID that was returned when\nthe settlement window was created.\nThis call returns a SettlementWindow object. This object will need to be\nextended to include the name of the settlement model to which the settlement\nwindow belongs.\nGetting information about settlement windows using parameters\nThe existing API definition (see Ref_2 above) supports a\ngetSettlementWindowsByParams resource. This function allows its user to\nobtain information about all settlement windows which meet the criteria\nspecified by the user. The following changes will need to be made to this call:\n\nThe parameters supported by the call will need to be extended to allow a\nuser to request settlement windows by settlement model. The user should be\nable to enter the name of a settlement model.\n\nThis call returns an array of SettlementWindow objects. It is assumed\nthat these objects will have been changed by the changes specified in\nSection 6.2.2.2 above, and that no further processing will be required for\nthis call.\n\n\nRequesting a settlement\nThe existing API definition (see Ref_2 above) supports a createSettlement\nresource. This function allows its user to request a settlement for a given set\nof settlement windows, which are passed to the resource as parameters. The\nfollowing changes will need to be made to this call:\nThe parameters for the createSettlement resource are defined in the\nSettlementEventPayload object. This object will need to have a parameter\nadded to specify the settlement model which is to be settled. The parameter\nshould be called settlementModel, and it should be a string. It should be\nrequired.\nThe following validation should be performed on this parameter when the request\nis received via the API:\n\nThe content of the parameter is a case-insensitive match for an active entry\nin the settlementmodel table, ignoring whitespace.\n\nThe settlementtypeid column in the record in the selected settlement model\nshould not point to a record in the settlementdelay table whose\nsettlementDelayName value is “IMMEDIATE”. If it does, the request should\nbe rejected and an error message returned to the caller.\n\n\nThe id of the settlement model requested should be stored in the\nsettlementModelId column of the row created in the settlement table to\ndescribe the settlement.\nReturning the status of a settlement\nThe existing API definition (see Ref_2 above) supports a getSettlementById\nresource. This function allows its user to obtain information about a settlement\nby giving the ID that was returned when the settlement was created.\nInformation about settlements is returned in a Settlement object. A\nparameter should be added to the Settlement object to record the settlement\nmodel which is being settled by the settlement.\nThe parameter should be called settlementModel, and it should be a string. It\nshould be required.\nNote: when a settlement is requested, a reason is given; but the\nSettlement object does not contain the reason. It might be worth including\nthis in the definition of the Settlement object.\nGetting information about settlements using parameters\nThe existing API definition (see Ref_2 above) supports a\ngetSettlementsByParams resource. This function allows its user to obtain\ninformation about all settlements by giving the ID that was returned when the\nsettlement was created. The following changes will need to be made to this call:\n\nThis call returns an array of Settlement objects. It is assumed that\nthese objects will have been changed by the changes specified in Section\n6.2.2.5 above, and that no further processing will be required for this\ncall.\n\nGetting information about a specific participant in a settlement\nThe existing API definition (see Ref_2 above) supports a\ngetSettlementBySettlementParticipant resource. This function allows its user\nto obtain information about a settlement which meet the criteria specified by\nthe user. The following changes will need to be made to this call:\n\nThis call returns a Settlement object. It is assumed that this object\nwill have been changed by the changes specified in Section 6.2.2.5 above,\nand that no further processing will be required for this call.\n\nUpdating a specific settlement\nThe existing API definition (see Ref_2 above) supports an\nupdateSettlementById resource. This function allows its user to update\ninformation about a settlement by giving the ID that was returned when the\nsettlement was created.\nThis call returns a Settlement object. It is assumed that this object will\nhave been changed by the changes specified in Section 6.2.2.5 above, and that no\nfurther processing will be required for this call.\nUpdating a settlement for a specific participant\nThe existing API definition (see Ref_2 above) supports an\nupdateSettlementBySettlementParticipant resource. This function allows its\nuser to update information about a settlement by giving the ID that was returned\nwhen the settlement was created, and the participant whose information is to be\nupdated.\nThis call returns a Settlement object. It is assumed that this object will\nhave been changed by the changes specified in Section 6.2.2.5 above, and that no\nfurther processing will be required for this call.\nUpdating a settlement for a specific participant and account\nThe existing API definition (see Ref_2 above) supports an\nupdateSettlementBySettlementParticipantAccount resource. This function\nallows its user to update information about a settlement by giving the ID that\nwas returned when the settlement was created, and the participant and account\nwhose information is to be updated.\nThis call returns a Settlement object. It is assumed that this object will\nhave been changed by the changes specified in Section 6.2.2.5 above, and that no\nfurther processing will be required for this call.\nRecording the deposit of funds by a participant\nThe existing administration API (see Ref_3 above) contains functions to enable\nan administrator to record a deposit made by a participant to an account. This\nprocess is described in Section 5.2 above. The API should be changed to align it\nwith the structures used in the existing settlement API described in Ref_2\nabove. In addition, the signature of the API should be extended to allow the\nadministrator to specify the account type that will be updated by the deposit.\nRecording the withdrawal of funds by a participant\nThe existing administration API (see Ref_3 above) contains functions to enable\nan administrator to record a withdrawal made by a participant from an account.\nThis process is described in Section 5.3 above. The API should be changed to\nalign it with the structures used in the existing settlement API described in\nRef_2 above. In addition, the signature of the API should be extended to allow\nthe administrator to specify the account type that will be updated by the\nwithdrawal.\nNew resource: openSettlementWindow\nIn the current architecture, an instance of each settlement window is created\nwhen the instance is set up, and subsequent settlement windows are created by\nclosing the current settlement window. In the new settlement management\nstructure, we will need the ability to create new settlement windows where no\npredecessors exist: for instance, when an administrator decides to settle a\nparticular currency using a different settlement model.\nProcessing changes\nThe following processing changes are required to implement the changes required\nto support continuous gross settlement.\nAttributing ledger entries to the correct ledger account type\nWhen a ledger entry is created, it should be assigned to the ledger account type\nspecified in the ledgeraccounttypeid column of the row in the\nledgerentrytype table appropriate to the ledger entry type which is being\ncreated.\nFor example: if a normal entry representing a transfer is being created, it will\nhave a ledger entry type of PRINCIPAL_VALUE. It should be assigned to the\nPOSITION account type (the default position at present.) This implies that the\nmatch described in Section 6.2.1.3 above has been implemented.\nQuestion: how does the switch decide whether or when to construct a record in\nthe participantPositionChange table? How would it be possible to select the\nledger account type to which the position refers?\nProcessing interchange fees \nIn order to support the scheme model implemented by TIPS, we need to generate\nand settle liabilities incurred as a consequence of making transfers between\nparticular types of customer. The general form of this rule is as follows:\n\nIf the transaction is a wallet-to-wallet P2P transaction, then the receiver\nDFSP pays the sender DFSP 0.6% of the amount of the transaction.\n\nNo interchange fees are levied for on-us transactions.\n\n\nThe business decisions around this requirement are:\n\nThe definition of whether or not a payee account is a wallet will be\nreturned by the payee DFSP as part of customer discovery. The mechanism by\nwhich this is implemented is outside the scope of this document.\n\nInterchange fees will be captured by the switch when the transfers which\nincur them are completed.\n\nInterchange fees will have the ledger entry type INTERCHANGE_FEE and will be\nrecorded in accounts whose type is INTERCHANGE_FEE.\n\nInterchange fees will be settled multilaterally, net and deferred. It is\nexpected that this settlement will take place monthly.\n\nInterchange fees do not require liability cover by participants.\n\n\nThis functionality will be implemented as a partial instance of a general\nprocess for defining and executing rules, and for taking actions based on the\noutcome of evaluation of a rule. For this particular case, we propose the\nchanges described in the following sections.\nPart 1: Run script for batch update of interchange fees when settlement window is closed.\nInclude stories to manage account type definition\nPart 2: Add reservation on prepare using script and modify fulfilment to fulfil all ledger types for which an entry has been made\nEvaluating a rule\nThe process of evaluating a rule is based on the following assumptions:\n\nThere will be a standard form of rule evaluation with the following\nstructure:\n\nA transaction object will be passed as the parameter to the rule\nevaluation function.\n\nThe rule evaluation itself will use a complex if statement.\n\nIf the rule evaluates to TRUE, then an action should be executed as\ndescribed in Section 6.3.2 below.\n\n\n\n\nAn example of a rule function to evaluate a TIPS interchange fee rule could be:\nfunction evaluateInterchangeFee (transaction) {\nif(\n(transaction.payee.fspId.toLowerCase() != transaction.payer.fspId.toLowerCase())\n&& (transaction.extensionList[“payerAccountType”].toLowerCase() ==\n\"Wallet\".toLowerCase()\n&& transaction.extensionList[“payeeAccountType”].toLowerCase() ==\n\"Wallet\".toLowerCase())\n&& (transaction.transactionType.scenario.toLowerCase() ==\n\"TRANSFER\".toLowerCase()\n&& transaction.transactionType.initiator.toLowerCase() == \"PAYER\".toLowerCase()\n&& transaction.transactionType.initiatorType.toLowerCase() ==\n\"CONSUMER\".toLowerCase())\n) {\n// Do some good stuff\n};\n};\nTaking action after evaluating a rule\nIf a rule evaluates to TRUE as described in Section 6.3.1 above, then\nappropriate action should be taken. In the case of the immediate example of\ninterchange fees, the action taken should be to add two entries to the\nparticipants’ interchange fee accounts, on recording the debit from the payee of\nthe interchange fee amount and the other recording the credit to the payer of\nthe interchange fee amount.\nA simple yet general way of supporting actions of this type is to define a class\n(which might be called ruleAction) and adding methods to it to represent the\nactions to be taken. The rule evaluation function can then instantiate the class\nand call the appropriate function.\nIn the case of the interchange fees, we would define an action called\naddLedgerEntry, with the following parameters:\n\nThe transfer ID for which the ledger entry is being created\n\nThe ledger entry type to be used\n\nThe currency in which the amount is denominated\n\nThe amount of the fee\n\nThe FSP ID of the credit party\n\nThe FSP ID of the debit party\n\n\nThis might appear in the rule evaluation function as:\nmyAction.addLedgerEntry(transaction.transactionId,\ntransaction.transactionId,\n\"INTERCHANGE_FEE“,\ntransaction.currency,\ntransaction.amount*0.006,\ntransaction.payer.fspId,\ntransaction.payee.fspId);\nProviding a generic framework for rule evaluation\nFinally, we will need to provide a generic framework to trigger the evaluation\nof rules. This should be an array of evaluation functions, which are triggered\nwhen the status of a transfer changes to FULFILLED.\nDomain class diagram\nERD\nThe following ERD describes the new data structures required to model\nsettlements.\n\nEnumerations\nThe following enumerations are required to support the new ERD:\nDELETE FROM settlementgranularity;\nINSERT INTO settlementgranularity (settlementTypeName) VALUES ('GROSS'),\n('NET');\nDELETE FROM settlementinterchange;\nINSERT INTO settlementinterchange (interchangetypename) VALUES ('BILATERAL'),\n('MULTILATERAL');\nDELETE FROM settlementdelay;\nINSERT INTO settlementdelay(settlementdelayname) VALUES ('IMMEDIATE'),\n('DEFERRED');\n"},"mojaloop-technical-overview/central-event-processor/":{"url":"mojaloop-technical-overview/central-event-processor/","title":"Central-Event-Processor Services","keywords":"","body":"Central Event Processor Service\nThe Central Event Processor (CEP) service provides the capability to monitor for a pre-defined/configured set of business rules or patterns.\nIn the current iteration, the rules are set to monitor for three criteria:\n\nBreaching of a threshold on the Limit of Net Debit Cap (which may be set as part of on-boarding),\nAdjustment of the limit - Net Debit Cap,\nAdjust of position based on a Settlement.\n\nThe CEP can then be integrated with a notifier service, to send out notifications or alerts.

Tracing Design\n4.1 HTTP Transports\nBelow find the current proposed standard HTTP Transport headers for tracing.\nMojaloop has yet to standardise on either standard, or if it will possible support both.\n4.1.1 WC3 Http Headers\nRefer to the following publication for more information: https://w3c.github.io/trace-context/\n\n\n\nHeader\nDescription\nExample\n\n\n\n\ntraceparent\nDash delimited string of tracing information: \\-\\-\\-\\\n00-4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736-00f067aa0ba902b7-00\n\n\ntracestate\nComma delimited vendor specific format captured as follows: \\=\\\ncongo=t61rcWkgMzE,rojo=00f067aa0ba902b7\n\n\n\nNote: Before this specification was written, some tracers propagated X-B3-Sampled as true or false as opposed to 1 or 0. While you shouldn't encode X-B3-Sampled as true or false, a lenient implementation may accept them.\n4.1.2 B3 HTTP Headers\nRefer to the following publication for more information: https://github.com/apache/incubator-zipkin-b3-propagation\n\n\n\nHeader\nDescription\nExample\n\n\n\n\nX-B3-TraceId\nEncoded as 32 or 16 lower-hex characters.\na 128-bit TraceId header might look like: X-B3-TraceId: 463ac35c9f6413ad48485a3953bb6124. Unless propagating only the Sampling State, the X-B3-TraceId header is required.\n\n\nX-B3-SpanId\nEncoded as 16 lower-hex characters.\na SpanId header might look like: X-B3-SpanId: a2fb4a1d1a96d312. Unless propagating only the Sampling State, the X-B3-SpanId header is required.\n\n\nX-B3-ParentSpanId\nheader may be present on a child span and must be absent on the root span. It is encoded as 16 lower-hex characters.\nA ParentSpanId header might look like: X-B3-ParentSpanId: 0020000000000001\n\n\nX-B3-Sampled\nAn accept sampling decision is encoded as 1 and a deny as 0. Absent means defer the decision to the receiver of this header.\nA Sampled header might look like: X-B3-Sampled: 1.\n\n\nX-B3-Flags\nDebug is encoded as 1. Debug implies an accept decision, so don't also send the X-B3-Sampled header.\n\n\n\n4.2 Kafka Transports\nRefer to Event Envelope Model section. This defines the message that will be sent through the Kafka transport.\nAlternatively the tracing context could be stored in Kafka headers which are only supports v0.11 or later. Note that this would break support for older versions of Kafka.\n4.3 Known limitations\n\nTransfer tracing would be limited to each of the transfer legs (i.e. Prepare and Fulfil) as a result of the Mojaloop API specification not catering for tracing information. The trace information will be send as part of the callbacks by the Switch, but the FSPs will not be required to respond appropriately with a reciprocal trace headers.\n\n"},"mojaloop-technical-overview/fraud-services/":{"url":"mojaloop-technical-overview/fraud-services/","title":"Fraud Services","keywords":"","body":"Fraud Services\nProvides an overview of the monitoring and preventative measures in consideration to prevent and discourage fraudulent activities within the Mojaloop ecosystem.\nRelevant artefacts available for public consumption are shared within related-documents section.\n"},"mojaloop-technical-overview/fraud-services/related-documents/documentation.html":{"url":"mojaloop-technical-overview/fraud-services/related-documents/documentation.html","title":"Ecosystem Fraud Documentation","keywords":"","body":"Fraud Services\nArtefacts available for public reference related to the preventative measures in preventing and discouraging fraudulent activities within the ecosystem.\nList of current artefacts\nMojaloop Ecosystem Fraud Overview Document\n"},"mojaloop-technical-overview/sdk-scheme-adapter/":{"url":"mojaloop-technical-overview/sdk-scheme-adapter/","title":"SDK Scheme Adapter","keywords":"","body":"SDK Scheme Adapter\nA scheme adapter is a service that interfaces between a Mojaloop API compliant switch and a DFSP backend platform that does not natively implement the Mojaloop API.\nThe API between the scheme adapter and the DFSP backend is synchronous HTTP while the interface between the scheme adapter and the switch is native Mojaloop API.\n\nUsage\nScheme Adapter to Scheme Adapter\nScheme Adapter to Local K8S cluster\nScheme Adapter to WSO2 API Gateway\n\n\n\n"},"mojaloop-technical-overview/sdk-scheme-adapter/usage/":{"url":"mojaloop-technical-overview/sdk-scheme-adapter/usage/","title":"Usage","keywords":"","body":"Overview\nA scheme adapter is a service that interfaces between a Mojaloop API compliant switch and a DFSP backend platform that does not natively implement the Mojaloop API.\nThe API between the scheme adapter and the DFSP backend is synchronous HTTP while the interface between the scheme adapter and the switch is native Mojaloop API.\nThis document provides different ways of setups that a DFSP can test using the scheme adapter.\nScenarios\nThere are number of scenarios those we tested and documented as follows.\n\n[Scheme Adapter + Mock DFSP Backend] -> [Scheme Adapter + Mojaloop Simulator]\n[Scheme Adapter + Mock DFSP Backend] -> [Local K8S cluster]\n[Scheme Adapter + Mojaloop Simulator] -> [Public hosted WSO2 enabled Mojaloop Switch]\n\n[Scheme Adapter + Mock DFSP Backend] -> [Scheme Adapter + Mojaloop Simulator]\nThe scheme adpater can be used in combination with some already implemented mock backends \"Mock DFSP Backend\" and \"Mojaloop Simulator\".

Create a new application and access keys if you don't have those already.\nThen go to APIs menu, you should find the following applications. Subscribe to these two APIs by selecting your application and tier from the each API main page.\nCentral Ledger Admin API - We will use this endpoint for creating a new fsp and configure endpoints for that fsp. (Please contact your infra team for the proper https endpoints, they need to provision them on the hub)\nFSPIOP API - This is the main API for account lookup, quotes & transfers\n\n\nYou can try some api requests in \"API Console\" tab by selecting the generated access token.\nPlease make a note of the API URLs for both APIs and access token.\n\nInfrastructure Stuff\nThe following are the things your infrastructure team should take care off.\nPlease contact your infra team for further details.\n\nFor getting back the responses, we need a machine with static public IP. And a domain name should be pointed to that IP.\nGenerate client and server SSL certificates using MCM portal and keychain tool. This step is to establish secure communication using mutual SSL.\nProvision the endpoints pointing to your https address in WSO2 / HA Proxy.\nEstablish JWS authentication\nAWS Deployment\n\nLaunch an EC2 instance in AWS console\n\nCreate an EC2 instance in AWS console and select t2.micro instance type.\nSelect Ubuntu 18.04 as your operating system.\nAfter your instance is ready, you can connect to it using ssh and the downloaded key file from AWS EC2 dashboard.\nInstall docker and docker-compose in that EC2 instance\n\n\nOpen 4000 TCP port in security groups and assign elastic IP\n\nAdd the inbound rule in security group of this EC2 instance that will expose the TCP 4000 port to public\nUse Elastic IP service to assign a static IP for this instance\n\n\nSetup domain name for this instance\n\nYou can use route53 in aws or any other DNS service to point a DNS name to this IP address\nThis step is required because the Let's Encrypt certificate authority will not issue certificates for a bare IP address.\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting up Scheme Adapter with Mojaloop Simulator\nPlease download the Mojaloop Simulator repo\ngit clone https://github.com/mojaloop/mojaloop-simulator.git\n\nReplace the certificates and keys in src/secrets folder with the generated certificates in the previous step.\n\nEdit the file src/docker-compose.yml and change the required parameters.

You can get the postman repo from https://github.com/mojaloop/postman.\n\nDuplicate the \"Mojaloop-Local\" environment and change the following valuesin that\npayerfsp - extpayerfsp\nHOST_ML_API_ADAPTER, HOST_ML_API, HOST_SWITCH_TRANSFERS, HOST_ACCOUNT_LOOKUP_SERVICE, HOST_QUOTING_SERVICE - Your WSO2 FSPIOP API endpoint\nHOST_CENTRAL_LEDGER - Your WSO2 Central

token we created in WSO2 store for the entire \"Payer FSP Onboarding\" folder.\nChange the endpoint URLs to the https endpoints provided by your infra team.\nThen run the \"Payer FSP Onboarding\" folder in that collection with the newly created environment.\n\nYou should get 100% pass then we can confirm that the fsp is created and endpoints are set for the fsp.\nProvision payeefsp and register a participant against MSISDN simulator\nGenerally the simulator running in the switch contains payeefsp and you should register a new participant (phone number) of your choice.\nYou can refer the postman request \"p2p_happy_path SEND QUOTE / Register Participant  against MSISDN Simulator for PayeeFSP\" in \"Golden_Path\" collection to achieve this.\nThe postman request will send a POST

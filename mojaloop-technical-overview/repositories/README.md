# Repositories

The Mojaloop project is organized on the basis of component microservices. As such, there are over twenty different repositories in GitHub that align to the different services. The following four repositories are pinned to the project:

* The [mojaloop repository](https://github.com/mojaloop/mojaloop) contains the master readme file along with the following documents to get started.
* The [documentation repository](https://github.com/mojaloop/docs) documents the contributors guidelines, overall architecture, component design, message flow, and an overview of Mojaloop. 
* The [project repository](https://github.com/mojaloop/project) is the central repository to track product development issues for the Mojaloop project.
* The [mojaloop-specificiation](https://github.com/mojaloop/mojaloop-specification) contains the specification document set of the Open API for Financial Service Provider Interoperability.

Individual repositories in the [Mojaloop GitHub organization](https://github.com/mojaloop/) each describe component-specific details including source and APIs.
